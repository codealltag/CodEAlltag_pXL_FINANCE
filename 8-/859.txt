This original Ernaehrungssystem of Ihno Driftschroer

A dozen film girls - young actresses and dancers - whisked lively in
the champagne glasses which were filled newly again and again. Host
was a young Croesus who likes to mime photographic model himself. He
drew a pretty black-haired walker-on on the lap and kissed the left
forefinger, the 18-year-old Portuguese pin-up girl Lilly Vorstmann,
dressed up as an arab sheikh. A photo-journalist had to hold the
merriest poses tight in two hundred photos.
It is proper the obsession to sunbathe in the gleam of pretty girls or
to be able to to make a photograph of with Löwenbabies and polar bears
to the pastime of the host. It is no Adonis and none Yank but it has
boasted about a real bel for months of a fortune of one and a half
millions of marks. It has four cars and a cupboard full of suits got a
gold medal by a last stylish cut, among this a model, this on the
German tailor day, award-winning on Dezember 14. 07. 21 is apart from many
friends.

A hairy attribute which it describes as an "Assyrian beard" curled up
under its pointed chin. Only short time ago this announced BodenseeCenter
pageboy its simple civil name Ivan Driftschroer confessed the public.
It calls itself "merchant" if one asks for its profession, however,
lives - this got known to the court meanwhile - for years of the game
of chance.
