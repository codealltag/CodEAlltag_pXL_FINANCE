Today's high of 3008 was only 3 points below our fibonacci support level for
this wave, when combined with the strong intraday reversal indicates that
minute wave 1 is complete.

So 3008.5 becomes critical resistance. A push through 3009 is needed to
confirm the commencement of minute wave 3.

Minute wave 2 has gone about as far as it can before we need to consider
further downside targets. So we need a reversal now that holds above
2956.20.
