Es wird bestimmt ganz toll, wenn die 'juristerei' ihm nicht hilft
und er dann in irgendwelchen 'conspiracy theories' abwandern muss.

Mit etwas editing kam fogendes heraus, dem "der Unterzeichnete"
sicher folgen kann:

What They Don't Want You to Know
In order to understand why they don't help me you need to realize that
everything is controlled by some devils, made up of lawyers with help from
the government justice.

The conspiracy first started during our roulette software development in
Irschenberg. They have been responsible for many events throughout recent
times, including unlawful distribution.

Today, members of the conspiracy are everywhere in the de.etc.finanz.boerse
newsgroup. They can be identified by forging headers.

They want to dismay software protection and discourage resisters, not only
in Australia and Germany (not to forget Switzerland) using the newsgroup
and local police departments.

In order to prepare for this, we all must pretend to obey for now. Since
the media is controlled by the government, we should get our information
from psychiatrists and the "der Unterzeichnete".


Have fun, urs
