QuThe frequency chart shows that 260.2 is the critical point and the
critical resistance point is positioned at 261.4. If the market can
close above 262.6 this week, spot gold will look very positive. The
critical supporting point is located at 255.9. Two other projected chart
points are 256.5 and 259. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.6 and
all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a
multiple of this constant, 0.6. The normal trading range is 255.9 -
261.4 (determined by the computer), expected low is 259 and expected
high is 262.6 (my personal view). See details at the monthly cycle chart
if spot gold trades below 255.9 or above 261.4.
