Dear All,

Thanks for your information.

I don't have yet (now I think I don't have it never !) but
filosophically I had the idea to purchase it for my baby (near 2 years
old) who's received each time money for their great-parents and
great-great parents.

I thinked that usually it's young people (who's work !) they pay for
old one and with REFUGIUM investment it will be inverse !

But I will try to choose another investment.


Thanks again,
Math
