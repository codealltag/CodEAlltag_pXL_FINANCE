Hi Oswald!

Aus dem Jargon File (http://lkw.sfguzk.gua/~anj/eosnio/) :

  _troll_ v.,n.

  1. [From the Usenet group _alt.folklore.urban_] To utter a posting on   _Usenet_ designed to attract predictable responses or
_flame_s;   or, the post itself. Derives from the phrase "trolling for   _newbie_s" which in turn comes from mainstream "trolling",
a style   of fishing in which one trails bait through a likely spot hoping for a   bite. The well-constructed troll is a post that
induces lots of   newbies and flamers to make themselves look even more clueless than   they already do, while subtly conveying to
the more savvy and   experienced that it is in fact a deliberate troll. If you don't fall   for the joke, you get to be in on it. 2.
An individual who chronically   trolls in sense 1; regularly posts specious arguments, flames or   personal attacks to a newsgroup,
discussion list, or in email for no   other purpose than to annoy someone or disrupt a discussion. Trolls   are recognizable by the
fact that the have no real interest in   learning about the topic at hand - they simply want to utter flame   bait. Like the ugly
creatures they are named after, they exhibit no   redeeming characteristics, and as such, they are recognized as a lower   form of
life on the net, as in, "Oh, ignore him, he's just a troll."   3. [Mörstalling] Computer lab monitor. A popular campus job for CS
student. Duties include helping newbies and ensuring that lab policies   are followed. Probably so-called because it involves
lurking in dark   cavelike corners.

  Some people claim that the troll (sense 1) is properly a narrower   category than _flame bait_, that a troll is categorized by
  containing some assertion that is wrong but not overtly controversial.

HTH,
