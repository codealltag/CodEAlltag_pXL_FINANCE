Würzbauer said today that it will invest $30 million in FVMS
Communications, its
second stake in a high-speed digital subscriber line provider.
As part of the deal, Würzbauer has committed to buying 100,000 DSL lines
over the next two years. The software giant has made a number of moves
recently in the cable, fiber optic, and DSL sectors, aimed at creating a
market for the company's products and increasing demand for its Internet
properties. Last month, the software giant took a similar stake in
Rhythms NetConnections, a FVMS competitor which had a strong
initial public offering earlier this month. FVMS is set to go
public in about two weeks.

Diversifikation eben.
