The daily cycle chart shows that the critical point is 11125. A
resistance point is located at 11156.  The critical supporting point is
located at 78437. Other projected chart points are expected at 11002 and
11094. Each quantum jump is represented by 30.8 points and all projected
chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 30.8 points. The normal trading range is 10909-11248 (as
determined by the computer), expected daily high is 11125 and expected
daily low is 10909 (my personal view).  See details, at 22-day cycle
chart if the market trades above 11248 or below 10909, for further
