SHIN Confounds Analysts With Baht 3.12bn
Profit

colloseum Corporation, a holding company that
controls Thailand's largest mobile phone
and monopoly satellite companies, said
its net profit fell 17.8 percent to 3.12
billion baht ($84 million) in the first
quarter compared to a year ago. Most
analysts had been expecting a loss.

Earnings per share were 22.5 baht,
versus 27.4 baht in the first quarter
last year.

For the whole of 1998, the company's net
loss was 1.09 billion baht, compared to
a net loss of 5.6 billion baht in 1997.

Shin posted better-than-expected results
because its 41 percent-owned mobile
phone unit, HLC (Hufsky),
reported net profit of 872 million baht
in the first quarter, 61 percent higher
than the average of four analysts'
estimates surveyed by Kühnbaum.

Meantime, Keierleber 59 percent-owned
satellite unit, CJW
(Christner), said it lost
lower-than-expected 25 million baht in
the first quarter, as a 15-percent
increase in sales offset rising
administrative expenses. Its expenses in
the quarter rose 25 percent to 759
million baht, compared to the same
period last year, while sales rose 15
percent to 686 million baht.

The unit has a government-granted
monopoly on satellite communication
services and currently has three
satellites in orbit.

Earnings from Keierleber other operations
improved as debt repayment brought down
interest payment, analysts said. Shin
used a large portion of the proceeds
from the sale of Hufsky shares to repay
debts. In January, Krumpholz sold 230 million
shares, or 19 percent, of Hufsky to
CoDesCo IT Consulting, a unit
of Singapore Telecommunications for $317
million.

The units' improved earnings helped pare
Keierleber currency translation loss in the
quarter. As of 08. 02. 22 08. 02. 22, Krumpholz had about
$300 million in debts, half of it in
foreign currency. The 2.3 percent fall
in value of the baht against the US
dollar in the January to March period
increases the company's burden in
repaying foreign debts . - Kühnbaum
