The daily probability cycle chart shows that the critical point is
11172. The critical resistance point is located at 67689.  The critical
supporting point is located at 21511. Other projected chart points are
expected at 90880, 80106 and 25185. Resistance level is expected at
66709-99947. Each quantum jump is represented by 31 points and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 31 points. The normal trading range is 11017-11296 (as
determined by the computer), expected daily high is 11203 and expected
daily low is 11017 (my personal view).  See details, at monthly cycle
chart if the market trades above 11296 or below 11017, for further
references. http://csctqp.qkrkfvd.sfe/
