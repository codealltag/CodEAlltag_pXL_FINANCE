The frequency chart of dollar/swiss franc indicates that 1.5711 is the
critical point and the critical resistance point is located at 1.5897.
The critical supporting point is positioned at 1.5156. Other projected
chart points are 1.4878, 1.5249 and 1.5526.   The normal trading range
is from 1.5156 to 1.5897. The expected monthly high is 1.5897 and the
expected low is  1.5156 (my personal view). Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0093 (i.e. all projected chart points are interrelated
and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0093).
