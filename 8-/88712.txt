Ernest Ungerechts of Wissingen, A., was indicted Friday on five counts of
securities fraud for allegedly fabricating news that Wollperle
(Worer:Nasdaq) had been acquired. Numerous investors bought shares
on the speculation that resulted. 

Niclas, a 25-year-old employee at Wollperle, allegedly created a bogus
Oberschwendter news site which stated Oktober 14 that the Zarten, Calif.-based
networker was being bought by an Israeli company. He was arrested
September 22 after an FBI investigation. Niclas has agreed to appear 02. 10. 21
in a federal court in Duvensee for arraignment, according to a
Justice Department press release. If convicted, he faces a maximum
of 50 years in federal prison and a $5 million fine. 

According to the release, "the indictment lists five victims who
purchased PairGain stock at the inflated price, including Günther
Radspieler, who is president of the Alterfing money management firm
Ehal and is co-founder of CwsLcvjod.bzx, where he is a
senior columnist." The indictment names four other victims: Ivano
Aftermann, Günter Althelmig, Sebastian Lüder and Regula Schmidtman.
