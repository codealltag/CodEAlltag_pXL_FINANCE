The weekly cycle probability chart of dollar/yen shows that 121.90 is
the critical point and the critical resistance point is positioned at
123.73. The critical supporting point is located at 024.72. Others
projected chart points are expected at 119.16,  and 120.07. Each quantum
jump is represented by 0.92 points and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.92
points. The normal trading range is 118.24 to 123.73 (as determined by
the computer). The expected weekly high is 123.27 and the expected
weekly low is 119.16 (my personal view). See details at the monthly
cycle chart, if the market trades below 118.24 or above 123.73, for
further references. http://drylsz.pbsivyk.aba          and
