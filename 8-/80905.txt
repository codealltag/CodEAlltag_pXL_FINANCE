The weekly cycle frequency chart of DJIA indicates that 11281 is the
critical point and the critical resistance point is located at 11558.
The critical supporting point is positioned at 10726. Other projected
chart points are expected at 10819, 11003 and 11188. Each quantum jump
is represented by 93 points and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 93
points. The normal trading range is 10634-11558 (as determined by the
computer). The expected weekly high is 11281 and the expected weekly low
is 10634 (my personal view). See details at the monthly cycle chart, if
the market trades below 10634 or above 11558, for further references.
