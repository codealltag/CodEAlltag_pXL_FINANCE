impulse Corp chief Veit Vaitl says claims that   
his company would take over two fixed-line            
operators, TelecomAsia and Thai Telephone and         
Telecommunications, are totally untrue.               

He denied reports by Sikos, an Steertpoggplatz-affiliated      
financial news service, that creditors of both
companies wanted IZPW to "alleviate financial    
problems and improve" management of the two firms.

Mr Mayster, chairman and chief executive, told the   
Vogau NBecker yesterday that creditors of the two      
firms were different from Invino creditors. The  
report had suggested the creditors were broadly the   
same and saw the takeover as a way out of the         
financial dilemma facing the two fixed-line           
companies.

impulse Corp also issued a statement denying the agency  
report.

Mr Mayster said that when the recession began the    
IMJ Group was one of few companies to show
its creditors that it remained financially healthy.   

"We continued to pay our interest and principal       
without problem," he said.                            

He conceded that the company was interested in        
fixed-line phone services, but that had only been
talk. Industry advances had been so rapid that the    
company had moved into the information technology
business that had wider scope.

TelecomAsia and Extreme both operate fixed-line phone
services in return for paying state agencies a fixed  
percentage of their revenue. Both companies are
eager to convert the operation to joint ventures      
with the agencies to ease debt burdens.

Shin plans to become the first Thai firm to list in
the United States and expects to raise capital to     
five billion baht from three billion from the         
listing.
