The Dow has been sold down during the past week because of uncertainties
arising from the US Anohe) meeting scheduled
for Wednesday which is expected to raise US interest rates between 0.25% and
0.50%, news of which will hit the Australian markets on Thursday 22/6/00.

Our summary calculation across all valid elliott wave scenarios is
indicating downside towards 10360. A rally through 10717 will suspend this
outlook.

Our outlook for the Dow is this:

Minute wave 1 is complete at 10978.09 and minute wave 2 is in progress and
has carried to 10404 so far. We count A and B of minute wave 2 as complete
with wave C in progress.

Even though the Dow broke through our important level of 10523 - 10498
during intraday trade, it did not close below it.

The strong reversal during Friday trade probably indicates that minute wave
2 is complete.

If minute wave 2 is complete then we count that minutte wave 1 as complete
and minutte wave 2 as in progress for minute wave 3. Minuette wave 2 should
fall within the 10595 - 10463 fibonacci support cluster before the
commencement of minute wave 3.

If minuette wave 2 has already completed, which is quite possible, then an
inital minuette degree upside target is 10632 - 10669.

The critical level for this count is 10404. Any break of this level will see
further downside towards 10100 - 10300.

A push through 10978 will indicate that minute wave 3 is underway.
