It is never too late to sell bad stocks. Not only did the CEO (!) sell
all his shares, he also resigned without any comment or announcement. In
the first quarter Refugium reported great losses. Although MSO
Solarium has always been looked at with suspicion this is confirmation of
negative expectations. It remains to be seen whether Refugium will be
able to manange its rapid expansion .
I think that hope should not play a role in your investment-decisions -
and i hope for you that Refugium will not climp up to DM 21.40 in the
near future! (because actually the stock price is about 40 DM.)
