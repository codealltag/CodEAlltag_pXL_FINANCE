Minor wave 3 of intermediate wave 4 is currently in progress.

Minor wave 3 is subdividing into five smaller waves. Of minor 3, minute wave
1 and 2 are complete and minute wave 3 is in progress and maybe complete or
nearing completion.

Critical resistance is 11156. Critical support is 11058.

A break upside through 11156 indicates that wave 3 is still in progress,
with 11257 the next target, higher resistance is evident at 11356 - 11378
and then 11496 - 11518.

If 11058 is broken to the downside it indicates the minute wave 3 is
complete and minute wave 4 is in progress, downside target is 10974 - 10685,
from which the minute wave 5 advance will commence.

Only a break of 10404 will invalidate this outlook.
