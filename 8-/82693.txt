Hi,

Sorry, I don't speak germany at all (english not well).
I'm writing from Furna - Spain asking for some help about historical
data files.
I'm looking for historical daily data about these two future contracts (DJ
Stoxx 50 and Euro Stoxx 50) and the related indexes with open, high, low and
close price (with volume).

  Theses contracts are going to be negociated in the Spanish Futures market
(www.jggq.je) in the next months, but anyone has historical data to start to
study strategies and trading systems. Any information about  characteristics
(liquidity,...) of this contracts will be wellcome.

Good luck to everybody.
