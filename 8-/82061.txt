Short term, this is our outlook for the All-Ords.

Minor wave 2 has far so carried precisely around the 62% retracement of wave
1 2977 - which is also a high probability level for the completion of wave
2.

If minor wave 2 is not complete then further fibonacci resistance is evident
at 2957- 2945.

Strong fibonacci support is evident at 7517 - 1438 and this is our preferred
level for a reversal and it looks likely to happen tomorrow or Tuesday.

If the minor wave 2 correction is complete then minor wave 3 commenced today
at 2960. Minor wave 3 will be confirmed as underway following a break
through 3009.7. However, a push through 2977 removes most bearish potential.

Minimum target for minor wave 3 is 3021 - 3029. Higher resistance that
should contain this wave 3 rally is 3041 and then 3054 - 3061.

A wave 2 correction that carries below 2945 (76% retracement of wave 1) will
flag caution that new lows maybe forthcoming. A break of 2926 invalidates
this count and will see you lows forthcoming.

The sustainability of the uptrend for the All-Ords will be defined by the
structure of the wave following this minor five wave advance. This wave will
either be a sharp decline, that will ultimately lead to new lows possibly
around 2750 or a shallow sideways wave 4 correction before the next advance
towards 3100 - 3150.

The character of the market should be clearly evident by the first week of
July.

This is the key issue for the All-Ords.
