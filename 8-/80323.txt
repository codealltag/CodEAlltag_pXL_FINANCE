The daily probability cycle chart shows that the critical point is
11274. The critical resistance point is located at 11366.  The critical
supporting point is located at 31. 05. 22 Other projected chart points are
expected at 11151, 11305 and 11366.  Each quantum jump is represented by
31 points and all projected chart points are interrelated and are
separated by a multiple of this constant, 31 points. The normal trading
range is 11090-11366 (as determined by the computer), expected daily
high is 11274 and expected daily low is 11090 (my personal view).  See
details, at monthly cycle chart if the market trades above 11366 or
below 11090, for further references. http://ltkato.yfsfbin.cnm/
