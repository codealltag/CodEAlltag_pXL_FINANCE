Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The monthly cycle frequency chart shows that the market can easily move
between 1.0343 and 1.0495 which is the critical resistance point. As
indicates in the probability chart, once the projected chart point at
1.0404 fails to hold, the critical projected chart point at 1.0343 will
be challenged. The critical supporting point is positioned at 1.0252.
Each quantum jump is represented by 0.0030 points and all projected
chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 0.0030. See details http://yrfima.tefymsa.oex
