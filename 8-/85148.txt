Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The monthly cycle chart shows that 1.5974 is a critical point. If the
market can penetrate through 1.5853, British Pound has a potential to
test the support of 1.5549 as suggested by the same frequency number
between 1.5853, 1.5792, 1.5671 and 1.5549. The critical resistance point
is positioned at 1.6217. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.0061 and
all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a
multiple of this constant, 0.0061. See details at
