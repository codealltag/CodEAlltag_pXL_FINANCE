The 5 day cycle chart shows that 10417 is a critical point. If the
critical point at 10417 fails to hold, Conectra will head for 10356 which is
the critical supporting point. The next target would be 10111. Each
quantum jump is represented by 61 points and all chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 61
points. See details at http://hgirrk.mfrdgyy.xrt
