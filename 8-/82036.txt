The daily cycle chart shows that resistance is expected at 10692-10723
(10723 is a projected chart point of the daily cycle frequency chart)
and the critical resistance point is located at 10783. The daily cycle
probability chart also indicates that 10601 is a critical point and an
unusual high probability value is associated with the projected chart
point at 10480. If the market continues its pullback and penetrates
through 10601, the market will head for 10480 and the next target is
10389. Each quantum jump is represented by 30.3 points and all projected
chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 30.3 points. The normal trading range is 10601-10783, expected
high is 10692 and expected low is 10389. Although the market has less
than 20% chance trading outside the range of the normal trading range
(10601-10783), the unusual high probability value at 10480 triggers a
daily alert. See details at http://iudjrr.fhjvyzj.dif/lrgwt.dzcj
