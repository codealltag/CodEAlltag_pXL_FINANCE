The probability chart of Euro shows that 1.0147 is the critical point
and the critical resistance point is positioned at 1.0300. The critical
supporting point is located at 9.5212. Others projected chart points are
expected at 0.9963 and 0.9994. Each quantum jump is represented by
0.0031 point and all projected chart points are interrelated and are
separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0031 point. The normal
trading range is 1.0055 to 1.0300 (as determined by the computer). The
expected weekly high is 1.0300 and the expected weekly low is 0.9994 (my
personal view). See front page for current comment if the market trades
below 0.9963 or above 1.0300, for further references.
