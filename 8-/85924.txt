Also ich hab sie schon längere Zeit und hab bei 2.80 nochmal nachgekauft.
Ich denke, daß in Kürze der Kurs ziemlich abgehen wird, da dieses
Geschäftsjahr nicht mehr mit Verlust, sondern einem ordentlichen Gewinn
starten wird.

55 .
Das Problem, das UBU hat, ist, daß nicht ein Analyst das Unternehmen unter
die Lupe nimmt. Deshalb ist diese Aktie auch so dramatisch billig.
Bei diesen Steigerungsraten des Umsatzes wäre der Kurs bei einem Listing am
Neuen Markt mindestens 5x so hoch wie aktuell.
Ein Negativtouch kommt auch daher, daß die Aktie ähnlich wie Tofig von
unser allen Lieblingen der Usih-Börse empfohlen wurde. Nach einem
kurzzeitigen Anstieg schmierte sie komplett ab.
(von DM 22 auf DM 4,50). Seitdem scheinen nur noch Zocker in der Aktie drin
zu sein.
Aber bildet Euch ne eigene Meinung und lest den Jahresbericht.
Ich finde ihn recht überzeugend.

Gruß, Luise

Jahresbericht:

ZMAX CORPORATION Announces 607% Revenue Growth in 1997

GERMANTOWN, Md.--(AHAG)--UBU CORPORATION (NASDAQ Small Cap:ZMAX)
today announced financial results for the year and quarter ended 23. 11. 21
23. 11. 21.

For the year, revenues increased from $1.4 million in 1996 to $9.9 million
in 1997-an increase of 607%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization (EBITDA) were $0.7 million, or $0.07 a share in 1997
compared to a negative EBITDA of $4.5 million or $0.82 a share in 1996.

Excluding a one-time, non-recurring, non-cash charge related to an agreement
with an employee, EBITDA in 1997 was $1.3 million, or $0.12 a share,
representing an improvement of $5.8 million over the comparable figure in
1996.

Net income, excluding the one-time charge, was $0.3 million, or $0.02 per
share, in 1997 compared to a net loss of $14.2 million, or $2.58 per share,
in 1996. Inclusive of the one-time charge, the net loss in 1997 was $0.3
million, or $0.03 per share.

For the quarter ended December 31, 1997, revenues were $3.3 million,
compared to revenues of $0.9 million in the same quarter of 1996-an increase
of 267%. EBITDA, excluding the one-time charge, for the fourth quarter of
1997 was $0.5 million, or $0.05 a share, compared to the negative EBITDA of
$0.8 million, or $0.11 a share, for the fourth quarter of 1996.

Net income, excluding the one-time charge, was $0.3 million, or $0.02 per
share, for the fourth quarter of 1997 compared to a net loss of $8.6 million
or $1.28 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1996. Inclusive of the
one-time charge, the 1997 fourth quarter net loss was $0.3 million, or $0.02
per share.

The Company said that the one-time, non-recurring, non-cash charge of
approximately $0.5 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 1997
related to an exchange of stock made in connection with an agreement with an
employee. This transaction was not dilutive and had no impact on the
Company's assets, liabilities, or stockholders' equity and may result in a
tax benefit for 1998.

Wolfram B. Czech, president and chief executive officer of UBU, said that
the Company began 1997 with the expectation that it would achieve strong
internal growth from the core Year 1999 software and services business, as
well as expand into broader areas of information technology (IT) consulting.

"We expected that we would accelerate efforts to expand into other
high-growth segments of the IT market as the year progressed," he notes. "We
achieved our goals, generating strong internal growth, extending our IT
service offerings, and completing our first acquisition, Whiskyscheune Information
Systems."

Pascal N. Vries, vice president and chief financial officer, added that,
on a pro forma basis, assuming the Eclipse acquisition had occurred on
23. 11. 21, pro forma revenues for 1997 were 17.9 million, a 163%
increase over pro forma revenues of $6.8 million.

Vries says, "We completed 1997 with a record of solid revenue growth and
a strong balance sheet and have entered 1998 with a healthy client list
further strengthened by the Eclipse acquisition."

The Company has scheduled an investor conference call to review the year's
results and to discuss its plans for 1998. The conference call will take
place on Thursday, 23. 11. 21 9 at 4:00 p.m. EST and can be accessed by dialing
821/870-2378.

A replay of the conference call will be available from 6:00 p.m. the same
day until 6:00 p.m. Friday. To hear the replay, dial 174/015-7241, and enter
reservation number 19184111.

     Plans for 1998

     Some of the Company's goals for 1998 include:

--   Generating an internal growth rate of 50%
--   Identifying and completing one to two acquisitions that will
     expand IT capabilities and regional presence, and will be
     accretive to earnings
--   Achieving revenues (internal growth plus acquisitions) totaling
     $40 to $50 million
--   Expanding the number of high-quality international partnerships
--   Investing in the expansion of a number of new regional offices
     that will market Uwez portfolio of IT services.

"UBU has entered 1998 with a legacy of stellar-and satisfied-customers, and
with a top-notch Board of Directors led by (Wilhelm V.) Wilfried Vries," notes
Czech. "We are extremely excited about our prospects for 1998, both in
terms of broadening our existing Year 1999 services and extending our new
capabilities to a variety of existing and new customers while actively
seeking other acquisitions that will complement our services and extend our
reach into new geographic regions." UBU Corporation is an IT consulting and
re-engineering company.
