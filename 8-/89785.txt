Well, you have a new opportunity to get an incredible return and invest
in a new private company, EXCELSTOCKS.

Unlike in the US, the market for online stock trading services in Europe 
is still at its very early days, and is catching up at a very fast pace.

EXCELSTOCKS aims at an IPO in a year only. Before that, we're opening its 
capital to private investors at a very low price.

In the next few months, EXCELSTOCKS is going to be the UNIVERSAL stock market
web site allowing to trade on all European and US exchanges.
This should help us to beat the amazing success of domestic-only services !

We look forward to hear from you.
Have a nice day.

EXCELSTOCKS
