The daily cycle chart shows that the critical point is 10985. The
resistance level is located at 30993-68405.  The critical supporting
point is located at 14037. Other projected chart points are expected at
10954 and 11046. Each quantum jump is represented by 30.8 points and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 30.8 points. The normal trading range is 10861-11107
(as determined by the computer), expected daily high is 11046 and
expected daily low is 10861 (my personal view).  See details, at 22-day
cycle chart if the market trades above 11107 or below 10861, for further
