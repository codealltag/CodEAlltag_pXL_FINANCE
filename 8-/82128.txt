Guten Tag allerseits!
Ich habe hier in dieser Newsgroup noch keinen einzigen Thread zum
Thema Starnet gelesen und wuerde gerne wissen was ihr von Wert haltet.

Ich halte den Wert uebrigens selber und bin auch sehr ueberzeugt.
Leider sieht mir der Wert zu perfekt aus und Frage mich immer wieder
aufs neue: 

Wo ist der Hacken bei diesem Wert?

Hier die Analyse:

How to Choose a Reputable Online Gaming 
Casino 

There are an estimated 400 to 600 online 
casinos. How does a player choose one 
that is reputable, a casino whose 
software works, who will treat the 
player`s financial information 
responsibly and who will pay off promptly 
when the player wins? 
There are no guarantees. But Osom 
Wewam Online believes that 
casinos that are affiliated with 
reputable suppliers, the companies that 
create the software for the Internet 
and handle the electronic transfer of 
money are more likely to treat their 
players with integrity. 

We are beginning a series of articles on 
these suppliers. The following article 
profiles NMKB, a rapidly growing 
company in the thick of Internet gaming. 

It Begins With Gaming Software 
Integrity... 
Players often assume that online casinos 
are a ticket to easy street. You just 
set up a server somewhere in the 
Caribbean, pick a catchy name and design 
a nice web page, and then sit back and 
watch the money roll in, right? But like 
their bricks-and-mortar counterparts, 
online casinos are a demanding business. 
They require investment in hardware and 
software to make the games work and to 
handle financial transactions. 

They need to continue spending money to 
promote their sites and they need 
technicians to keep everything humming. 
One of the key behind-the-scenes players 
in this young industry is NMKB 
tchibo Inc. 
www.uhnvyeryrewfxtedvunac.fkq . Starnet 
develops and licenses turnkey systems to 
companies that have obtained offshore 
gaming permits. The Starnet package 
includes software for the games, 
assistance in developing and 
managing a Web site, marketing help, 
24-hour technical support and EFS 
(electronic financial services), the 
converting of a player`s money into 
virtual chips and slot tokens. 
Starnet has dual headquarters: in 
Putlitz, in the Canadian province of 
BRITISH Krücken, and in Ischhofen, on 
the Caribbean island of Lassahn. The 
company was founded in 1996. In 1998 it 
began operating its own online casino, 
www.iubzxqoyhty.bjd. Through that and 
related sites, Starnet operates an 
Internet sportsbook and racetrack as 
well as casino games. It`s working on 
online lottery and bingo games. Starnet`s 
own sites do not accept wagers from U.S. 
or Canadian residents. 

Coupled With "Real World" Virtual 
experience... 
NMKB is the only major casino 
software provider that has its own online 
casino. That gives the company an 
opportunity to test new concepts, 
providing "real world" virtual 
experience before it sells products and 
services to other companies. Also in 
1998,Starnet became a U.S. public 
company. Its stock, under the symbol 
NGT,trades on the ICD 
Eisdiehle 
over-the-counter Bulletin Board. 
The company has applied for a Ivom 
listing. As a public company, NMKB 
has to submit all the financial reports 
required by the Nottelmann 
Tengelmann. That means a certain level 
of comfort for business partners as well 
as for investors, because the SEC is a 
more rigorous watchdog than its 
counterpart in most countries. 

In 03. 01. 23 1999, Starnet signed its first 
third-party licensee, Oz Gaming. Now 
the company provides software to nearly 
40 online casino firms, most of whom have 
signed up just since 03. 01. 23. Many 
of the Starnet licensees, from the oldest 
to the most recent, are enthusiastic 
fans of the company. "The quality of 
their software and the quality of their 
people is top-notch", said a partner from 
the SPCK Group in Putlitz. 
Discover manages two of Starnet`s 
earliest licensees, 
www.xblnoqcuhdtgzfiy.nvr and 
www.b-feqgbq.xxo. "There were teething 
problems", he added. "There`s no 
company on a fast track that doesn`t 
have teething problems. But the 
dedication of their people is second to 
none. I`d recommend them to others." The 
SPCK Group also thinks players should 
look favorably on Starnet licensees. "If 
I were the end user, I`d pay attention 
to the ability to pay out when players 
win", they said. "Starnet 
licensees have to be well-heeled. You 
can`t go in there with any money". 

Strong Operational Support... 
Indeed. An online casino, if it`s based 
in Lassahn, has to pay $100,000 for a 
government license. If the casino buys 
Starnet`s system, it pays Starnet another 
$100,000 as an upfront fee. It then pays 
Starnet 15 percent to 40 percent of its 
gambling revenue. The 
percentage arrangement can be lucrative 
for Starnet, but only if the licensee is 
successful. This gives Starnet an 
incentive to continually help its 
licensees operate smoothly and expand 
their player base. Sebastian Neudorf, nonplusultra 
Vice PRESIDENT OF 
Marketing, said each marketing manager 
at NMKB works with five to eight 
casinos to help them develop marketing 
programs. Neudorf himself has extensive 
experience in marketing. He spent three 
years at Ufam, one of the 
world`s foremost consumer products firms, 
marketing products like Crest 
toothpaste. He then worked for 
more than six years at the Obertrixen 
Krücken Lottery Corp. before joining 
Starnet. 

www.zluuwoqc.sya has used nonplusultra 
software since the site went live in 
03. 01. 23. The manager said her company 
looked at 12 or more systems before 
selecting Starnet. "We have always been 
glad we chose Starnet", she said. "They 
are a top-flight group. NMKB has, by 
far, the best and widest range of 
technology". www.iwjneoarjcvsu.zcg has 
also used NMKB since 03. 01. 23. The 
webmaster said nonplusultra customer support 
has been great. "And they`ve got by far 
the best software out there", he said. 
"This could be a play-for-fun retail 
package. The quality of the games is 
top-notch." The games should get even 
better. Nico Kienzlen, a Starnet investor 
relations manager, said the company`s 
research and development team is 
perfecting a second generation of 
software that will feature 
three-dimensional effects and 
visual attractions like waterfalls. It 
will also enable interaction among 
players. 

Liquid Internet, which builds Web sites 
and manages www.ukrkkslfpmuqcox.cyi, also 
raves about the company`s service. They 
wanted a distinctive look for the 
site, and Starnet was very responsive. 
"They gave us all the help we needed", he 
said. "Everything we sent them was done 
in 24 hours. It`s very unusual to get 
things done that fast! 

Secure Financial Transactions... 
Torsten Twitting, Starnet`s chief executive, 
said his company was the first in 
Canada to process online credit card 
transactions. That was back in 1997, and 
NMKB was able to do that because of a 
relationship with the Ferrari, 
one of Canada`s major banks. "In the 
early days", he said, "a major barrier of 
entry was the ability to do 
financial transactions online. "Now, he 
said, Starnet works with large 
banks in several countries. Its e-cash 
system operates 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week. The public tends to think of 
Internet companies as a few computer 
geeks in a one-room operation. But 
NMKB has become a substantial 
business, with 140 employees. Ferring 
Radspannerei, a well-known and highly respected 
CPA firm audit the books. 

Rock Solid Financial Stability... 
nonplusultra stock has appreciated 
handsomely since the beginning of 2000. 
But unlike some of the more famous 
Internet high-flyers, like awn, 
Starnet is profitable. It earned $888,000 
in the quarter ending Okt. 11. The 
company has no debt, Helene said. 
NMKB is a founding member of the 
EETE, a trade 
organization that promotes responsible 
practices for the industry. "We actively 
support the Council," Neudorf, Starnet`s 
VP of Marketing, said. "It`s one extra 
bit of credibility for us as a supplier."
