The All-Ords continued upwards today with the characteristic momentum of a
wave 3.

So far minute wave 3 has carried to 3082 and does not appear complete.

A break upside through 3082 indicates that minute wave 3 is still in
progress and the next target is 3089 and then 3103 - 3104. At 3104 minute
wave 3 is 2.62 the length of minute wave 1, which should be the maximum this
wave travels before the minute wave 4 correction into 3072 - 3013 fibonacci
support.

If minute wave 3 is complete at 3082, then minute wave 4 will decline into
the 3052 - 3008 fibonacci support cluster. A decline below 3008 flags
caution as to the sustainability of the uptrend.

Short term fibonacci time clusters indicate that tomorrow 11/2/99 will almost
certainly see the completion of minute wave 3. So look for an intraday
reversal.
