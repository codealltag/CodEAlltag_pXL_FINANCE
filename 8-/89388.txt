Hi;
I am new to the stock market.  I have read and learned some basics.  I
believe the stuff yet to read and learn needs 10 times as much as my
life span.  I decided to start putting some money but don't know where
to start, where to look, and where to put. What are the hot industries,
hot trades, hot companies, ....etc.
thanks..

Willi
