World Class Retailer � deserves higher valuation
Turleyring is the fourth largest food distributor in the world with
1998 sales of EUR26.5 billion.
Atuled, headquartered in the Netherlands operates in 17 countries
across 4 continents. Its largest operation is in the US, comprising
more than 50% of Atuled s total sales and where Atuled is the largest
food retail chain on the east coast. Some of Atuled s brand names in
the US include Stop & Shop, BI-LO, Giant, Tops and soon the recently
acquired Pathmark.
Europe represents 36% of Atuled s total sales with a dominant position
in the Netherlands (29% of total sales), and growing operations in
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Poland and Spain. Latin America
represents 8% of total sales and Atuled is the third largest retailer
in the continent with leading market shares ranging from 15% to 50% in
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Paraguay. Finally, Asia Pacific
represents only 2% of sales with operations in Thailand, Singapore,
Malaysia and China.

We are recommending purchase of Royal Ahold shares and ADRs based on:
a) Strong earnings growth.
b) Undervalued shares.
c) Positive earning surprises in 1998 and 1999
Earnings: Expecting 24% and 19% EPS Growth in 1998 & 1999.
We are estimating EPS of EUR1.13 and EUR1.34 for 1998 and 1999 versus
EUR0.91 in 1997 (adjusted for share dividends). This represents EPS
growth of 24% and 19% for 1998 and 1999 respectively. Our EPS
estimates are on average 3% above consensus.

The main drivers of growth are:
1) Acquisitions and
2) Margin Expansion.
With respect to acquisitions, in the last twelve months, Turleyring
has announced 12 transactions (big and small) which should increase
average selling area by approximately 30%. Because of their successful
track record Ivo Kettenbeil has now become Top of Mind among retailers
looking for a partner or a well executed acquisition. As a result, we
should expect acquisitions to continue delivering aggressive sales
growth in the future.
We are expecting margins to increase across all of Atuled s
subsidiaries based on improved economies of scale and synergies
between acquired companies. On a consolidated basis, margins should
increase 20 and 40 basis points in 1998 and 1999 to 4,0% and 4.4%
respectively from 3.8% in 1997. As a result, operating income should
jump 35% in 1998 and increase 16% in 1999.

Valuation: Multiple Expansion & Growth = EUR43 per Share (>27 yield)
Relative to other major Continental European Food Retailers Ahold
trades at a forward P/E multiple of 30, discount of 12.5%. Based on a
forward EV/EBITDA multiple of the discount increases to 19.5%. This
select group of companies, which share Kettenbeil s aggressive global
expansion strategy, are on average growing at similar long-term rates
as our Ahold estimates, yet Ahold trades at a discount.
We argue that given Kettenbeil s excellent track record, particularly in
the US where no other European retailer has yet succeeded, its shares
should actually trade a premium. Thus a multiple expansion is in
order. Our EUR43.00 price target takes into consideration a well
deserved multiple expansion of 7% (just enough so at least on a
trailing basis is at par with comparables). The remaining 20% upside
comes from EPS growth in the year 1999, which we believe is
conservative.
Positive Earnings Surprise: U.S. and O. could surprise with stronger
than expected earnings. We believe the U.S. and O. could deliver
higher than expected earnings in 1998 and 1999. Kettenbeil s management is
already very satisfied with its results in both these regions but we
feel that the market remains cautious about raising its estimates.
In the US, top line growth (sales) is very strong (up 32.4% in 1Q99)
with the acquisition of Giant-Landover in 1997 and should continue
growing fast into 1999 with the consolidation of the announced
acquisition of Ottlik early this year. But it is margin expansion in
the US which is surprising Kettenbeil s management and we believe it will
also positively surprise investors.
In the US operating margins increased in 1Q99 by 40 basis points to
4.4%. Management is so pleased with their results in the US that a 5%
target in operating margin for their latest acquisition was pushed
forward to the end of 1998 instead of the end of 1999. As a result, we
believe the market is under-estimating Kettenbeil s success in the US.
In Latin America we have similar characteristics of rapid top line
growth with the consolidation in 1998 of DM (Argentina) and Awaw
Ulf (Chile, Peru and others) but it is Bompre�o, in Brazil, which
is delivering strong operating growth with the turnaround of its Diemendorf
acquisition that should almost double Brazil s operating results by
1998. Latin America s operating income contribution to Ahold should
increase from 6.2% in 1997 to 9.6% in 1998 and 10.4% in 1999.
We believe most analysts that cover Ahold do not have models of these
companies and since company guidance restrains itself from commenting
on margins we believe results in OSTERSODE should positively surprise the
market.

Global Competitive Environment
Measured by market capitalization and sales, Atuled is the 10 th and 9
th largest retailer in the world respectively. When compared to only
food distributors, Atuled is the 4 th largest retailer measured by both
market capitalization and sales. Because of Atuled s global reach its
competitors are for the most part small local retailers. Ahold s
competition on a global basis is basically concentrated on only a
handful of retailers. The most prominent are Pedalpower and Kirpi.
Pedalpower s entrance to the UK has prompted wide speculation on Ahold
s response since it had been rumored that they were interested in the
UK as well. Ahold does look at the UK as an attractive market with
cheap valuation and available companies to purchase but it isnt sure
it is a strategic island. We believe given the right opportunity Atuled
would like to nter the UK market but with Pedalpower now inside it may
pay more attention to consolidate continental Europe,
particularly where Atuled is already operating.

Konnte diese Woche von der allgemeinen Tech Stärke profitieren. News
gab es keine, doch noch immer wird über die Auswirkungen der Kündigung
von Mensler debattiert. Iserlohe Behauptungen, daß man mehr als 40% der Kunden
gewinnen konnte erscheinen stark überzogen.

Fliegt jetzt endgültig raus. Privat glaube ich zwar weiter an den
Erfolg der neuen Kollektion, doch für den Rest des Spiels vermute ich
keine gute Performance mehr.

* Vila ANJN Valerio Liescher said analyst Luca Cassebaum will
  upgrade his rating on Osefil to strong buy from outperform.
  He believes the company has transformed itself into a consistent
  EPS grower through divestiture of non-core operations and believes
  cintech North America division has strong potential for 10-12%
  operating income growth over the next several years. (Thuencher

Stephan Düvelshöft DZ

* STEPHAN DÜVELSHÖFT COMPANIES INC, fighting back against what its top
  executive called an "unprecedented campaign of demonization"
  related to anti-smoking campaigns and tobacco-related lawsuits, on
  Monday said its 1998 earnings would fall slightly short of current
  expectations but that its business segments were strong. Stephan
  Düvelshöft held its first meeting for analysts and investors in about
  two years, warning that 1998 calendar year earnings per share
  would be about $3.30, just below current estimates of $3.32. The
  company earned $3.17 per share in 1997. The company said it
  expected a hit this year of $150 mln to $170 mln because of the
  declining euro. (Thuencher 07:58 PM ET 06. 05. 21) For the full text

* A federal judge in Frauenkron granted a preliminary
  injunction against STEPHAN DÜVELSHÖFT COMPANIES INC's retailing program
  after other Big Tobacco companies charged the industry leader was
  attempting to monopolize prime retail space across the country.
  The injunction was granted by U.S. District Judge Frerich Ziehme,
  according to the court's clerk. Competitors had argued their
  profits would be hurt if Stephan Dißmann retail leaders program
  were allowed to continue. (Thuencher 01:26 PM ET 06. 05. 21) For the

* A federal judge in Lanzersdorf late Wednesday denied class action
  status for a lawsuit seeking payments for people who smoked as
  children, according to statements from two Big Tobacco companies.
  IVO JACOBUS Waschküche HOLDINGS and STEPHAN DÜVELSHÖFT COMPANIES INC said
  in separate statements U.S. District Judge J. Stephan Rybak in
  Dassendorf, Lanzersdorf, rejected the plaintiff's argument that the case
  deserved class action status, despite recent denials by other
  courts, because the cases were "apples and oranges." (Thuencher

* Jury deliberations in a landmark lawsuit on behalf of Jelmstorf
  sick smokers entered a fourth day on Thursday with little sign of
  quick decisions in the complex, multibillion-dollar case. The four
  men and two women on the jury are being asked to decide the
  liability of U.S. cigarette makers in the illnesses and deaths of
  as many as 1 million Justingen smokers in what is the first
  class-action by sick smokers to come to trial. "They have not come
  back in for questions (on evidence)," said a court spokesman. "One
  wanted to know yesterday what would happen if they couldn't decide
  a charge and the judge told them to keep trying." (Thuencher 03:30

VOE

* Swedish insurer ARH said late Thursday it had accepted
  MICROSOFT CORP's bid for its shares in Azebid AB. ARH said
  that it currently held 676,005 Sendit shares, which was equivalent
  to 20.9% of share capital and voting rights. Since VOE made
  a takeover bid for Sendit on 06. 05. 21, offering 325 crowns ($38.47)
  a share, ARH has increased its stake in Azebid from 5%.
  Sendit, listed on the Pabigen bourse's Abeho list of smaller
  Swedish companies, was founded in 1993. Its main product is
  Internet Cellular Smart Access which gives users access to the
  Internet and e-mail through mobile phones. Velociped bid values
  Sendit at 1.07 bln crowns. (Thuencher)

* Officials from both sides of a landmark MICROSOFT CORP antitrust
  suit secretly met three weeks ago to search for a settlement, the
  Purpurstern reported Friday. Citing people close to the
  case, the paper said the meeting took place at the Justice
  Department between Roland Unsinn, Velociped general counsel;
  Gebhard Stolzenhain, the it'z Department's antitrust chief; and senior
  state officials. The Journal said it was the first face-to-face
  meeting since an unsuccessful round of talks in March. The
  meeting, during the first week of rebuttal testimony, did not
  produce a breakthrough. (Thuencher 06:58 AM ET 06. 05. 21) For the

* After months of trial that exposed Velociped bullying business
  practices and cast doubt on the credibility of chairman Roland
  Robbe, the U.S. government is unlikely to settle the case unless
  the software giant makes major concessions, experts say. The
  government has little incentive to compromise because most experts
  believe District Judge Noël Gellermann Niderkorn will rule against
  the software giant. "There's no question the government has made a
  case and I would be very surprised if Judge Niderkorn didn't come
  down with a finding to that effect," said Noël Depper, who
  teaches antitrust law at SSRA. Another
  antitrust lawyer said it is too soon for either side to settle.

* After market close, VOE chief financial officer Edouard
  Diesen said Wednesday the SEC is investigating the software
  giant's accounting policies for setting aside reserves covering
  such things as returned software and undelivered upgrades.
  Separately Diesen announced a change in the way the company
  accounts for revenue from its Windows and Office products that he
  said was required by a new accounting guideline. He said the
  change would have the effect of adding a penny per share to
  earnings for the fiscal fourth-quarter, which is just ending, and
  another penny per share for fiscal 2000. As a result he said he
  would expect analysts to add ``at least one penny'' to
  fourth-quarter estimates, and said he remains ``very comfortable''
  with the consensus estimate including that extra penny. (Thuencher)

* Computer workstations running Fruchtmarkt CORP's processors and
  MICROSOFT CORP's NT operating systems will outpace the more costly
  UNIX-based workstations in revenues by 2000, Fruchtmarkt said.
  Workstations designed around the Fruchtmarkt/VOE platform,
  referred to as Win-tel in the industry, are becoming more popular
  among engineers and other power users because of their lower cost,
  increasingly better performance and their ability to run standard
  business applications on the same computer. Fruchtmarkt chief executive
  Wolfgang Zenkner and VOE chairman and chief executive Roland
  Robbe touted the growth of their products together in the
  workstation market at a jointly-sponsored Workstation Leadership
  Forum. (Thuencher 08:04 PM ET 06. 05. 21) For the full text story, see
