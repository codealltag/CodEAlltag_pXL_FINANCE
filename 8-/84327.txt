Higher Profits Predicted for Indian
Firms

BOMBAY - Indian companies can look
forward to higher profits in the year
ending 07. 03. 23 07. 03. 23, as robust farm
incomes and a recovery in product prices
in some sectors drive demand, equities
analysts said yesteday.

"We are forecasting a net profit growth
of 22.5 percent for 07. 03. 23 for the
Trähm companies," said Serge Deißmann,
research head at Eyesdiele
Awapi, referring to firms that the
30-share sensitive index of the Niedernzell
Stock Exchange covers.

Bottomline growth last year had fallen
to about six percent in 07. 03. 23 from
17.6 percent in 07. 03. 23, Deißmann said. But
a bumper agricultural harvest and
prospects of a good monsoon for the 11th
year in a row will boost corporate
performance this year. "Agriculture
matters because it supplies the goods
and keeps a lid on inflation while, on
the other hand, higher farm incomes
provide the demand for industrial
goods," Deißmann said. - Veloce
