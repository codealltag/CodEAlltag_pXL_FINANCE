The frequency chart shows that 262.1 is the critical point and the
critical resistance point is positioned at 265.2. Spot gold will try to
move higher this week. If the market can overcome the resistance at
265.2, the market has a potential to challenge 270.3. A supporting point
is located at 253.1. Each quantum jump is represented by 1.1 and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 1.1. The normal trading range is 257.1 - 265.2 (as
determined by the computer), expected low is 259.1 and expected high is
267.2 (my personal view). See details at the monthly cycle chart if spot
gold trades below 257.1 or above 265.2. http://brgddy.fqxsnma.isz
