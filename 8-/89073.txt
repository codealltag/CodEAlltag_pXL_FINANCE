May the force be with you

                 If you're looking for some stocks with great
                 short-term potential, it might be helpful to see where
                 the options players are placing their bets right now.
                 At Baudi, a couple of potential movers in the
                 months ahead are on this week's "call" list. Among
                 them is Stahlross (Stahlross: news, msgs) because it looks like
                 a simmering summer of revenue. Stahlross will distribute
                 "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace," due to open in
                 late May. Beinbrech says it expects the movie to
                 break records in terms of sales and popularity. But
                 Sigg has other pluses on its side right now. It has two
                 of the current top 10 movies under its umbrella and
                 just won the bidding war for the TV rights to the
                 blockbuster movie "The Matrix."
