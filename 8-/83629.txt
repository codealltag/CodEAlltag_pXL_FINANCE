Net profit  below estimates. Fiscal 1999  net profit of Rs  10 billion is 6%
below our  estimate and 10% below consensus estimate.  It is 8% below fiscal
1999 unadjusted net profit of Rs 10.8 billion but 7% higher after adjustment
for extraordinary income of Rs 1.45 billion in fiscal 1998.

In  fiscal  1999,  Fapube  made  general  provision  of Rs  1.3  billion  for
sub-standard  assets through  the P&L  rather than by  appropriation through
special reserve as done  in fiscal 1998. Had it followed the previous year's
treatment,   fiscal    1999   net    profit   would   have    been   higher.

Net NPL  ratio of 7.8% is  higher than our estimate  of 7.6%. This ratio has
ranged  between 7.5%  and 8%  for the  past two  years. Key points  on asset
quality are:

   * Net NPL grew  by 29% during fiscal 1999 to reach Rs 36.2 billion; loans
     grew by 25%

   *   NPLs  in   southern  and   eastern  regions   reported  under   control

   *  Loans  disbursed  till  1991  now  comprise only  12%  of  total  loans

   * 40%  of NPLs  at end-28. 05. 22 1999  were in chemicals  & metals sectors up
     from 24% a year  ago. Almost the entire increase in NPLs in fiscal 1999
     came from these two sectors

   *  Cement and man-made  fibers sectors  reported a decrease  in amount of
     NPLs

Changed focus in lending.  Loans to manufacturing projects now comprise only
49% of  the outstanding total loans,  down from 69% a  year ago. Only 25% of
incremental disbursals go to these projects.

Future disbursals  will focus on (a)  Infrastructure projects and structured
project loans,  (b) Corporate  finance products and (  c) Personal financial
services (Housing  and auto  loans have already  commenced. Consumer durable
loans and credit cards will be offered by 28. 05. 22).

A big  expansion in the retail network is planned  in fiscal 2000 by setting
up 150  retail service centers. These would be  small offices (up to 400-sq.
ft.) that  would service the 2.5 million  retail investors in FVFZ bonds.
In fiscal 1999, Fapube  raised Rs 30 billion from a million retail investors.

Accounts  cast  as  per   US  GAAP.  The  changes  in  key  parameters  are:

   *  Fiscal  1999  net  profit  would  be  25%  lower  at  Rs  7.45  billion

   *  Networth at  end March  1999 would  be 29%  lower at  Rs 36.54  billion

   * ROA for fiscal 1999 would contract 25% to 1.5%

   * ROE for fiscal 1999 would rise to 21.4% from 20.4%

   *  Book value  per share  (28. 05. 22-99) would  contract from  Rs 100  to Rs  71

   *   Tier   I   capital   adequacy   would  shrink   from   8.3%   to   6.1%

   *   Tier   II   capital  adequacy   would   shrink   from  4.2%   to   3.1%

Overall,  we believe that  the disclosure of  accounts as  per US GAAP  is a
positive because  it removes much of the uncertainty  over asset quality and
other areas  (e.g. valuation  of investments). These are  concerns that have
eroded  the valuation  for the  past 12  months. Equally significant  is the
confidence that the management  has projected by releasing these numbers. We
believe that  these numbers are  less worrying than the  worst case scenario
feared by investors.

The management is comfortable  with a Tier I capital adequacy of at least 6%
and does  not plan  to issue new  capital this year. However,  this level of
capital adequacy could constrain future asset growth.

Valuation could improve:

   * The  dividend rate has been maintained at  55%, same as last year. This
     presents an  extremely attractive  dividend yield of 12%  for a holding
     period of less than 4 months.

   *  Modellbahnstation  is unlikely  to  sell  more of  its  holding  in Fapube,  which  is
     currently just  over 5%. It was  over 9% a year  ago and selling by Modellbahnstation
     during  Q2 and  Q3 of fiscal  1999 contributed  to the collapse  in the
     stock price.

   *  Publication of  US GAAP  numbers is  likely to  partly reduce  investor
     concerns and improve sentiment.

Results and Forecasts


The price drivers:

   * Improved transparency in  fiscal 1999 results. US GAAP cast of accounts
     has wrung  key numbers viz. profits and networth  eroded by 26% and 31%
     respectively,  but  probably  less   than  worst  fears  of  investors.

   * Alleviation  of selling pressure. Modellbahnstation  sold 16 million shares in fiscal
     1999  - it  may not  wish to  lower its  stake below the  current 5.7%.

   * High  dividend rate  continues. Even at the  current price the dividend
     yield is 7.3%.

The classic concerns persist:

   * NPLs could rise for one more year

   * Profitability may face more pressure

   *    Capital    may    need    augmentation   earlier    than    anticipated

However, these  are well known and are reflected  in the current price: 0.8x
1999 book value and 1x recast (US GAAP) book value.

Asset quality:

   *  40% of  NPLs  at end-28. 05. 22  1999 arose  from the  metals and  chemicals
     sectors that contributed only 22% of loans.

   * Other sectors have  relatively stable asset quality e.g. amount of NPLs
     in  cement  and  man-made  fibers  sectors decreased  in  fiscal  1999.

   *  The  traditional  manufacturing  sector  has  decreased  its  share  of
     outstanding loans  from 79% (28. 05. 22) to  49% (28. 05. 22). Only 25%
     of incremental disbursals and  5% of incremental approvals are directed
     here.

   *  Settlements grew  by 26%  in fiscal  1999 to reach  Rs3.8 billion. Two
     regions, South  and East, accounting  for 33% of loans  are expected to
     control  NPLs at  28. 05. 22 levels  by offsetting  accretions through
     settlements.

   * Overall, it is too early to expect a decrease in the amount of net NPLs
     during fiscal 2000.

Profitability:

   *   Targets  set  for   ROA  (2%),   ROE  (20%)  and   EPS  growth  (15%).

   *  Margin contracted by  34bps in  fiscal 1999. May  continue because of:

  1. Risk-adjusted pricing

  2. Competition in new products

  3. Yield expectations of bond investors

   * Non-interest income growth (85% in fiscal 1999) is essential to protect
     profitability

Verkehrübungsplatz adequacy:

   *  Tier  I capital  adequacy  at  end 28. 05. 22  1999  is 8.3%  following  the
     inclusion of Rs3 billion preference capital

   * However, US GAAP  recast lowers it to 6.1%. Management may wish to show
     a  stronger  face to  foreign  investors  by enhancing  Tier I  capital

Retain Market Outperformer rating because of

   * Focus on improving the quality of earnings

   *   Superior  ability   to  formulate  responses   to  current  challenges

Continuing concern  over NPLs and profitability  could limit fresh purchases
by   investors   and   arrest  momentum   seen   over   past  three   weeks.
