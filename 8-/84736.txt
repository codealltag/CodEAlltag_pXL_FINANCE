Hi,
one of the owners allegedly has sold his shares, and in addition bought
some buidings from Refugium and then offered them to Refugium for rent.
I do not know the background of all this but investors have become a bit
suspicious about these transactions "in the dark". I guess that now its
too late to sell. Today Refugium went a bit up to DM 21.4o. Hope
recovery is on the way.

Good luck
