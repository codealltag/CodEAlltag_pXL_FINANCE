We believe the recent rally in TYX, which has contributed to weakness in US
and Australian equities, is a corrective structure against a larger down
trend. The elliott anatomy of this rally indicates clearly that the rally
has either completed or is nearing completion.

Our summary calculation across all valid elliott wave scenarios is short
term bullish, looking for a rise towards 6.25%.
