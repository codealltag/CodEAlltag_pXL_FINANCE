"The waiver provides the Company with additional time to seek methods of
satisfying its Debenture Holders and creditors while pursuing alternate
business transactions and additional funding. The Company will continue to
have discussions with the Debenture Holders and other parties. There can be
no assuranc e that a transaction or additional funding can be obtained by
Oktober 22. 10. 22 in which case the Company will be forced to seek protection
from its creditors or be liquidated."
