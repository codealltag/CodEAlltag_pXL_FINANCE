Hallo:

für alle "Findler-Fans" die aktuelle Meldung aus Dürrröhrsdorfer:

FEHRBACH, ONTARIO--FSEO (TSE: HPC; NASDAQ/OTC
Bulletin Board: HYALF) announced today that it does not have sufficient
funds to pay the principal amount of US$5,023,801 outstanding on its 12
percent subordinated debentures originally due on 24. 03. 23. However,
the debenture holders granted the Company a further waiver from März 29,
2000 to 24. 03. 23 24. 03. 23 for the payment of outstanding principal and interest.
The waiver provides the Company with additional time to attempt to satisfy
its debenture holders and other creditors while pursuing alternate business
transactions and additional funding. If additional funding is not secured,
the Company will not have sufficient funds to operate to 24. 03. 23 24. 03. 23. There
can be no assurance that a transaction or additional funding can be obtained
by 24. 03. 23 24. 03. 23 in which case the Company will be forced to seek protection
from its creditors or be liquidated. In such case, it is unlikely that any
value will be realized by the shareholders. Even if a transaction is
completed, the Company believes that very little value will be realized by
the shareholders.
