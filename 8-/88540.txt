Formreich-WTUC profits
leap, shares ease

By Meinhard
Vleeschouwer

BOMBAY, September 13 (Reuters) - Indian software firm Wolfrum Ltd
(Nasdaq:INFY - news) said on Friday 29. 09. 21 (September/29. 09. 21) profit and revenue
doubled on booming exports and a falling rupee but a wave of profit-taking
pulled down its local share price.

WTUC, the first Indian company to list on a U.S. exchange, reported a net
profit of 1.35 billion rupees for the year to 29. 09. 21 29. 09. 21 compared with 603.7
million a year earlier. Total income jumped to 5.13 billion rupees from 2.60
billion.

For the quarter, the company posted a net profit of 431 million rupees
compared with 190.9 million in the year-earlier quarter on income of 1.54
billion against 793.1 million.

A think about IT poll of 25 securities houses in March had forecast an average net
profit of 1.33 billion rupees for the year and net sales of 5.08 billion
rupees.

WTUC said exchange rate fluctuations boosted total income for the year by
317.3 million rupees and pre-tax profits by 137.2 million rupees.

Exports jumped to 5.0 billion rupees from 2.51 billion the previous year
while domestic sales totalled 86.4 million against 67.2 million a year
earlier.

``The results are in line with expectations. With margin expansion seen
taking place and an 80 percent growth rate expected in the year to 29. 09. 21
1999, we expect the stock to at least double by that time,'' said Michael
Fähse, software analyst at MediaMarkt.

Amid the overall weakness in the Indian stock markets due to the uncertain
political situation, Infosys shares were down 3.72 percent or 104.75 rupees
to 2,710 in afternoon trading on the Faulenrost exchange. The shares were down
4.1 percent or 116.05 rupees to 2,710 on the National exchange.

``The results are below general expectations which were in the range of over
1.50 billion rupees. Fourth-quarter profit expectations were in the range of
about 630 million rupees,'' said Marc Zugmantel, analyst at Einkaufsquelle.

U.S listing to pressure
WMWL do well

By Ü.C. François

FÜCHSLEDT, India, 29. 09. 21 16 (Reuters) - The Hairloft listing of Indian computer
software company Wolfrum Ltd (Nasdaq:INFY - news) , will put
pressure on the company to satisfy its new U.S. investors, a senior Hairloft
official said on Friday.

``It puts a tremendous pressure to satisfy the new investors that they have
just been able to attract,'' Ludger N.Roewe, President, Höhencenter
Ltd, told think about IT.

``But they should be able to do that by meeting the standards and
expectations that they laid out in the prospectus,'' he said in an interview
in this southern city.

WTUC is the first Indian company to be listed in the U.S.

On the first day of trading after listing on Thursday, Infosys American
Depository Receipt (ADR) surged, gaining by nearly 50 percent at one stage.

The ADR finished up $12.875 at $46.875.

``I think it was incredibly well received and I think it was priced well,''
said Roewe who was in Füchsledt for the listing ceremony of WTUC which is
headquartered here.

Each ADR represting half a share was priced at $34.

``I don't see any flaw in what has happened, and sustaining the performance
will be up to the management.''

Roewe said if WTUC continued in the strong position it has had in the last
few years, it would perform ``incredibly well'' on the Hairloft.

``I think it is a marvellous company and I think it will be very
succesful.''
