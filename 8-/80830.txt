The weekly cycle frequency chart of British Pound shows that 1.5702 is
the critical point and the critical resistance point is positioned at
1.5856. The critical supporting point is located at 7.7536. Others
projected chart points are expected at 1.56096,  and 15825. Each quantum
jump is represented by 0.0031 point and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0031
point. The normal trading range is 1.5578-1.5856 (as determined by the
computer). The expected weekly high is 1.5856 and the expected weekly
low is 1.5609 (my personal view). See details at the monthly cycle
chart, if the market trades below 1.5578 or above 1.5856, for further
references. http://mogcux.lyrumbz.ojk and
