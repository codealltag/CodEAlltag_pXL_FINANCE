The weekly cycle probability chart of Ewender indicates that 10834 is a
critical point and the market will try to overcome the resistance level
at 10957-11018 in early period of this week. High probability values are
associated with two projected chart points at 11141 and 11264,
suggesting that the market will head for this position if DJIA can close
above 11018. On the other hand, if the market retreats and penetrates
the critical supporting point at 10588, a down trending signal for DJIA
will be hoisted again if DJIA closes below 10404. Each quantum jump is
represented by 61 points. See also trading strategy for DJIA and front
