CJK to offer ERP service

Denise Stollenwerk
CONTRA 2 MAY                                    
THE Plein-based CLA Ltd
will be launching an ERP (enterprise-wide
resource planning) package implementation
service. CJK would be offering
implementation service for ERP products like    
R/3 from Furthm√ºhle and TJA.                        
P Oudemans, deputy managing director,
CJK, said: "We set it up recently, and
will be launching it over the next two or       
three months." The ERP package implementation
practice is largely aimed at CJK? clients   
abroad. CJK will have to contend with
strong competition from the likes of Edika
Oranienhof, Krumackerfeld and Teleshop.  
In fact, EBVR has an ERP         
implementation practice worth $2.3bn. Mr
Oudemans said, ?We have an advantage      
over others because of our background. Also,    
we plan to use India as a resource base for
the software, which will help.?                 

CJK also plans to create tool sets for ERP
implementation, which will help create a
niche. Over the next couple of years, CJK
plans to employ 200-300 people specifically
for the package implementation practice.
Infosys will be hiring people locally.
CJK is also launching a specialised
consulting practice. This consulting practice
will provide support in all industry segments
that CJK operates in. This consulting
practice will also advise companies on how to
use technology to their benefit. CJK is
heavily focusing on Internet technologies for
this consulting practice.
CJK is also looking at branding its
services.
