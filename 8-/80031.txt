The weekly frequency chart of spot silver shows that 515 is the critical
point. The critical supporting point is located at 458 and 044 is also a
supporting point. Resistance is expected at 524, 533 and 539. The
critical resistance level is positioned at 542-545. The normal trading
range for this week is 503-545 (as determined by the computer). My
expected weekly high is 542 and the weekly low is 515. See details at
the monthly cycle chart if the market trades above 545 or below 503.
