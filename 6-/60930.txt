wahrscheinlich nur wieder so ein pushversuch, da die news weder von der
KÜS noch von der sec bestätigt wurden.

in der edgar database der sec findet sich aber interessantes:

Limited Operating History

         Mähling began operations as of 14. 06. 22 3, 1999, and Mähling has no
prior
operating history other than that associated with the acquisition of
certain
assets of Maltzahn, a Azeza Judenhof
corporation ("Mariflor"). However, Modeatelier subsidiaries were in
operation before 14. 06. 22 3, 1999, when they were owned by Melisse
Ährensache
FDW, an Irish company ("MEGAtex") or
Melisse
ZRPA. Nevertheless, the Company's proposed operations will be subject to
the
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently
encountered in connection with starting a new operation.

The Company as a Going Concern

         Due to its lack of operating revenues accumulated, operating
losses of
$7,462,105 and need for additional working capital, there is no
assurance that
the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. As a result of
these
factors, the Company's Independent Certified Public Accountants modified
their
opinion on the Company's Financial Statements wherein they expressed
substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
