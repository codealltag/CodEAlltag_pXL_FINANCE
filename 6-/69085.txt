Dear reader,

Excuse me please, but I would like to inform you
about new finance information resources in Internet.
All of the public pages with selected and sorted links (unfortunately, in a
simplified text version) are intended for Educators and Professionals in
finance and accounting, and mostly related to World and Russian
governmental, municipal, financial and other informational resources , and,
as I believe, may be of interest for the people mentioned above.

We would like also to have contacts with a German 2-3 year (financial)
college about possible joint distance education projects in finance during
1998-1999 school year and direct correspondence between Russian and German
students (in English and Deutsch).

With the best wishes!
