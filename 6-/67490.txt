DJIA :- The weekly cycle chart of DJIA shows that if the market can
overcome the resistance at 10856, DJIA has a potential to test the
projected chart point at 10978. The pattern of the projected market
profile also suggests that the chance is high that the market may pull
back from 10978 later this week and if the market momentum is strong
enough to penetrate 10551 and hit 10428, the supporting point at 10062
is likely to be challenged. See details at http://xgvesp.rpnsjtt.qwl
