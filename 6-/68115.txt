Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The pattern of the weekly cycle frequency chart of British Pound shows
that the market will continue its down trend movement this week. The
market may retrace back to 1.6630 - 1.6691. A projected chart point is
located at 1.6448, however it may not be strong enough to hold the down
trend momentum. A stronger support is expected at 1.6326 and I am
expecting the weekly low at 1.6387. (This analysis is based on a
mathematical model, Quantum Index Analysis. All projected chart points
are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of a constant, 0.0061
point). See details at http://wqrbxp.yfrqoyt.oon
