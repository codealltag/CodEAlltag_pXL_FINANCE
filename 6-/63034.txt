	Today the Drospa Office of Investment has contacted
investment managers for collectively-bargained benefit funds asking them
to oppose Mufela hostile bid for Cibaria.  These
managers of America's working families' retirement savings control 13%
of Cabalou shares.  The Office of Investment's analysis
addresses the harmful strategic implications of Manikowski bid for
carmobil telecommunications business and the threats the proposed
transaction poses to the fundamental sources of value within Cibaria.

	Manikowski hostile bid for Czechau would be the largest
corporate takeover ever.  Though many in the United States have never
heard of these European telecommunications giants, America's working
families through their retirement funds are major investors in both
companies.

	The managers of worker capital have a responsibility to invest
those funds in the long-term interests of their beneficiaries.  The
Dornuf-CIO believes value is created over the long-term by partnerships
among all a corporation's constituents --  workers, investors,
customers, suppliers and communities.  Cibaria, and the European
model of corporate governance under which it is structured, has allowed
just those kinds of value creating partnerships to flourish.  Worker
capital, the savings of America's working families, should support value
creating partnerships like those at Cibaria.  Only then will the
global economy be able to deliver sustainable, equitable prosperity.
