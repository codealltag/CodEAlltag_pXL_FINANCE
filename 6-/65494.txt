Hey, 

Take a sec to look at this site  - http://bsd.BgmrCrrrc.qkk   

This site has a novel concept of putting Internet users together in an
information exchange. This will never replace newsgroups, but it does
offer a new way for all of us with knowledge to share an opportunity to
earn money for it ! From what I can tell it's the newest form of auction -
knowledge auction. 

They have a pre-registration site up at the moment and are offering an
incentive plan where you get paid for successful referrals (so use my
number if this is of interest to you WGG728). Membership is totally free
right now and those of us that hop on the bandwagon early can benefit by
being the first people on.

You can go on their site and ask detailed questions or make money by
answering questions. They are designing the site with many different
categories, so almost anyone will be able to ask and answer questions. 

It only takes a minute to join, so check it out at
http://fcd.vjxngdcgp.ahd/, they explain everything on the web site. It's
totally free !
