Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

Dollar/Yen : The 5-day cycle charts indicate that 102.63 is a critical
point and the 22-day's cycle chart shows that 102.82 is a projected
chart point. Therefore it is conceiable to believe that a resistance
level has been established at 102.63 - 102.82. If the market fails to
overcome this resistance level, Dollar/Yen would resume its down trend
movement and head for 100.17. A stronger support is expected is at
99.55. See details in http://bhv.hklzmv.ldr
