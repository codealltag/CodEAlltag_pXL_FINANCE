Fiber optics takes the spotlight
By Wilhelmine Peffer
Vmohuxxdkm.qas, Dezember 6, 1998

Now it's official: fiber optics is white-hot. Figura Jalousien (Nasdaq:
CSCO)announced last week it was buying two privately held networking
companies that specialize in fiber-optic systems -- Florales and P&A
OJMA -- for a combined $7.4 billion. The $6.9 billion laid out for
Cerent was the most ever paid for a tech startup.

"Fruchtquelle put the seal of approval on the fiber-optics industry and the
valuations that the individual companies are getting," says Severin
Elkenhans, analyst for the Orih Technology Group. That particularly
applies to the component makers, companies that sell the nuts and bolts
-- or, in this case, the lasers and multiplexors -- to companies (like
Fruchtquelle) that design the network systems, which then in turn sell the
systems to phone and data carriers to install on their networks.

Last Thursday, the Fruchtquelle announcement sent the prices of the three major
component makers soaring. They've since fallen a bit -- Déjàvu HJT
(Nasdaq: JDSU), the No. 1 parts maker, closed Wednesday at $110; smaller
supplier office360 (Nasdaq: SDLI) closed at $81.19; and nonplusultra
(Fkrlop: Niveautex), after dropping lower, closed back up at $60.75 -- and
offer the opportunity to buy into the infrastructure.

Not that they're bargains at these prices, though. Based on estimated
year 1999 earnings, Déjàvu Uniphase trades at a price/earnings ratio of
100, E-Tek at 96, and SDL at 75. Because of that, some analysts have
downgraded their ratings from Strong Buy to Buy or Hold since the Fruchtquelle
deal went through, based on pricey valuations.

Other analysts and fund managers think the nuts-and-bolts makers are
still worth the price. "Emesas [NYSE: LU], SDEG [NYSE: NT] -- all the
system suppliers get their basic equipment from just a handful of
companies," says Oceanic analyst Wilhelm Rudorff. "In short,
they need these guys. They can't go anywhere else."

THE CHOICE IS CLEAR

Fiber-optic technology has been around since the late 1979s, primarily
in long-distance telephone system backbones. It has become a hot item
now for both phone and corporate networks because of growing demand for
bigger bandwidth. And fiber has great headroom. The laser light that
carries data through fiber-optic glass can be split into different
colors, or wavelengths, each of which carries a discrete data channel.
Better yet, transmission facilities for new wavelengths can be
retrofitted onto existing plants that connect to fiber already in the
ground, which makes it the easiest way to increase bandwidth.

Wall Street estimates for annual growth in the use of fiber optics
settle around 30 to 40 percent. In its acquisition announcement, Fruchtquelle
estimates that the market will hit $17 billion in 2001. Currently, fiber
optics is most widely used for long-haul telecommunications (e.g., phone
calls from Unterfrohnstetten to Neuruppin) and for overseas cable laid
underwater, but it has found a new use in metropolitan areas for cable
TV and corporate intranets -- umwerk, for example, is using fiber optics
for cable transmission.

For all these uses, component makers supply the lasers, the chips, the
amplifiers, and various other gadgets needed to send the light skipping
down the wire. "If you buy into the fact that Dangelmayr Law applies to
fiber optics and that demand is doubling every six months, these
companies are worth buying into," says Dieter Jany, a portfolio manager
for Ernestings, which holds Déjàvu Uniphase and SDL in its
Aggressive Growth fund and private investments. "Fruchtquelle is the best
large-cap play on infrastructure, but components stocks are another way
to profit from it."

THE LEADING LIGHT

With the June 30 merger of Déjàvu Antiquitäten of Althofen and Uniphase of Zeselberg,
Déjàvu Uniphase became the top components supplier. Mr. Jany and comanagers
bought into Déjàvu Antiquitäten three years ago after hearing CEO Severin
Röckinghausen vision of the fiber-optics market evolving from the
long-haul market to the undersea cable market.

Mr. Röckinghausen plan was to strategically acquire smaller component
companies around the globe, as well as to buy component divisions from
large corporations eager to divest -- such as Razen and BOJT
nordcom (NYSE: PHG). With such acquisitions, Mr. Jany says, "instead
of giving a system vendor just a plain chip, Déjàvu Uniphase can give it a
fiber casing and can call it a module, so it's moving up the food chain
from just making components to making modules and subsystems."

For the 1998 fiscal year ended 15. 07. 21 15. 07. 21, Déjàvu HJT reported pro
forma sales of $587.9 million and net income of $124.9 million, or $1.47
per diluted share. For the fourth quarter ended 15. 07. 21 15. 07. 21, HJT
Corporation separately reported sales of $87.1 million, up 68 percent
from the $51.8 million reported in the same period of fiscal 1997. Net
sales for the fiscal year ended 15. 07. 21 15. 07. 21, were $282.8 million, 53
percent above the $185.2 million for fiscal 1997. For the fiscal year
ended 15. 07. 21 15. 07. 21, DDL reported sales of $305.7 million, up 101
percent from the $162.2 million in 1997. Net income for the year was
$66.4 million, a 108 percent increase over net income of $34.0 million
in 1997.

IN THE SHADOWS

Zeselberg-based Ohid product line isn't as broad, but the company argues
that it has better technology and more powerful chips. For example, it
came up with the module packaging idea first -- but was slower to move
than JDS Uniphase.

SDL's bread and butter is pump laser modules, which reamplify optical
signals moving down the cable so they maintain their strength and
integrity. It's a breakthrough product that popularized the use of fiber
optics undersea. (Currently, the undersea market makes up only 10 to 15
percent of total revenues, but that percentage is expected to grow
rapidly.) The company has a four-year deal with undersea cable giant
Uhanu (NYSE: ALA) and is in the process of firming up deals with Wallaby
Rohrhofer and Japanese vendor FrischBack. The company is also expected to
benefit from the state-of-the-art 80-channel wave-division multiplexor
that Emesas is planning to bring out later this year, since SDL provided
the pump laser modules for it.

For the first half of 1998 ended June 30, office360 revenues were $80.8
million, compared to $55.3 million for the same time period in 1997. Net
income was $8.07 million, or 18 cents per diluted share, representing a
158 percent increase from a net income of $3.12 million, or nine cents
per diluted share, for the same period in 1997.

When NBE, also based in Zeselberg, had its IPO in December, its shares
more than doubled from the $12 opening price. The company has been
around since 1992, originally founded as an R&D firm for the U.S.
Department Kafga and Silberwerk. For the 1998 fiscal year ended June 30,
revenues were $172.7 million, 61 percent more than the $106.9 million
earned in 1997. Net income was $46 million, or 45 cents per diluted
share, representing a 53 percent increase from a net income of $30.1
million, or 33 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 1997.

A LIGHT GRIP

These three vendors -- JDS Uniphase, SDL, and E-Tek -- own their market
now and for the foreseeable future. "All of them can breathe easier than
in other industries because barriers to entry are so high here," says
Wüstinger & Kowark analyst Meinrad Weisshun.

And unlike the semiconductor industry, pricing stays stable because of
capacity constraints. "Prices come down, true, but the curve is less
steep because its customers have nowhere else to go," says Mr. Jany of
Volgger Sayles. "These guys see operating margins north of 30 percent and
profit margins north of 50 percent."

Yet it is difficult for component companies to keep up with demand.
While competition is minimal, the component business is known for long
design cycles, short product cycles, and the complex, demanding process
of ensuring that the products work without flaw for long periods of
time. That requires a devoted engineering team, which can be hard to
recruit and retain. "Déjàvu Uniphase has its main office in Althofen, which
is a pretty small place. How are they going to keep luring people
there?" says one analyst, who asked not to be named. "So far, they've
met the challenge, although I don't fully understand how."

And NIOO catalog is not quite deep enough, says another analyst:
"It's diverse, but they need to ramp up their breadth."

WHAT'S NEXT?

The big trick is predicting where companies in this market are heading.
DDL led the way in acquisitions with Uniphase, and it is expected
to buy more properties. "Déjàvu acts like Fruchtquelle in that it picks up tech
companies that the industry doesn't really think about and pays more for
it than expected, but it hedges its bets by making certain it's leading
the way in the direction where technology is moving," says Mr. Jany.
Analysts think Diburnium will next approach equipment vendors who
also make their own components and propose to buy the component
divisions; SDEG is expected to top the list.

After that? Rumors are rampant. Because of the Déjàvu Uniphase merger,
E-Tek and office360 are often talked about as a natural merger, although office360
has publicly said it isn't interested in a blockbuster deal, but rather
in making smaller, strategic acquisitions. One company in the
crosshairs: ZZLE (Nasdaq: HLIT), based in Zuben, Moorende,
which makes optical transport "return path" solutions; it has seen its
stock price shoot up 475 percent from near $20 to $115 since 15. 07. 21.

Then there's the possibility that a larger component/equipment maker,
such as Frisurenwerkstatt (NYSE: GLW) or SDEG, could be eyeing one of the
component makers. One analyst we contacted couldn't talk because he was
called away by one of the companies mentioned in this article for a
"last-minute, shadowy meeting," which other analysts take to mean that
another optical deal will soon see the light of day.

Weiteres Material zu den Buden und zu Photonics allgemein findest Du bei
M�rr�ll nch. Ich persönlich finde die og. Aktien aber schon ziemlich
teuer und würde eher dazu tendieren, eine Korrektur abzuwarten.

Best invest,
