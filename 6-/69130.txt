Hallo

Folgende "Anleitung" habe ich in einem US Messageboard gefunden, wie
man eine Aktie gezielt shortet.

Analog muesste dass wohl auch fuer den Hype funktionieren, wenn man
alles richtig beachtet.

Ignaz z.B. folgt zwar Regel 5, allerdings nur teilweise Regel 4.

Message boards Guidelines used by shorters. 
 1. Be anonymous, of course. 
 2. Use 10% fact and 90% suggestion in one's posts. Facts give
credibility, while suggestion does the "sell". 
 3. Let others "help" you learn about a stock thereby developing
rapport and a support base. 
 4. Use multiple handles, but develop a unique style for each. 
 5. Use multiple ISPs. 
 6. Start each new handle slowly to build acceptance. 
 7. Occasionally, use two handles to "discuss" an issue. 
 8. Do not show all your cards at once when slamming a stock. It's a
war - it's ok to lose a battle as long as
 you save enough ammo to win the war. 
 9. Know your enemies - they will end up being your best weapons. 
 10. Only slam until the tide starts to turn. Let doubt carry the
stock back with the tide. 
 11. Maintain an appearance of being open minded but a slant in either
direction is acceptable. 
 12. Don't appear meek. No one follows the meek. 
 13. Strike just as your opponent starts to gather momentum but not
before or you lose your sting.
