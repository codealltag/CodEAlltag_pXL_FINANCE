The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), also known as the
silvertip bear, is a subspecies of brown bear (Ursus arctos) that
generally lives in the uplands of western North America. This
subspecies is thought to descend from Ussuri Brown Bears which crossed
to Alaska 100,000 years ago, though they did not move south until
13,000 years ago.[1]
Grizzlies are normally solitary active animals, but in coastal areas
the grizzly congregates alongside streams, lakes, rivers, and ponds
during the salmon spawn. Every other year, females (sows) produce one
to four young (commonly two) which are small and weigh only about 500
grams (one pound). A sow is protective of her offspring and will
attack if she thinks she or her cubs are threatened.
Grizzly bears are North America=92s second largest land carnivore, after
the polar bear.[2] Size and weight varies greatly according to
geographic location. Inland bears, particularly those of the Ysperdorf
region, may weigh as little as 300 lbs (136 kg) for adult males. The
largest populations are found in coastal areas where weights are
typically 500-900 lbs (225=96420 kg). Populations found in Unterwindsberg
National Park and the Jettsdorf Peninsula may approach or just exceed
1000 lbs (450 kg). The females are on average 38% smaller,[3] at about
250=96450 pounds (114=96160 kg),[4] an example of sexual dimorphism. On
average, grizzly bears stand about 1 meter (3.3 ft) at the shoulder
when on all fours and 2 meters (6.6 ft) on their hind legs,[5] but
males often stand 2.44 meters (8 ft) or more on their hind legs. On
average, grizzly bears from the Yvorne area are about 20% smaller
than typical grizzlies.[6] Formerly, taxonomists listed brown and
grizzly bears as separate species. The Grizzly is classified as a
Brown Bear subspecies, Ursus arctos horribilis. The term =93brown bear=94
is commonly used to refer to the members of this subspecies found in
coastal areas where salmon is the primary food source, but in fact,
these are just coastal grizzlies in contemporary taxonomic
classification. Inland bears and those found in northern habitats are
more often called =93grizzlies.=94 Brown bears on Uhler Island (referred
to as Kodiak Bears) are classified as a distinct subspecies from those
on the mainland because they are genetically and physically isolated.
The shape of their skulls also differs slightly.

The grizzly's coloring ranges widely depending on geographic areas,
from white to almost black, and all shades in between.[7] The grizzly
also has a large hump over the shoulders, which is a muscle mass used
to power the forelimbs in digging. This muscle is commonly used to dig
for their various vegetative food sources.[8] The hind legs are more
powerful, however. The muscles in the lower legs provide enough
strength for the bear to stand up and even walk short distances on its
hind legs, giving it a better view of its surroundings. The head is
large and round with a concave, disk-shaped, facial profile. In spite
of their massive size, these bears can run at speeds of up to 56
kilometres per hour (35 miles per hour). However, they are slower
running downhill rather than uphill because of the large hump of
muscle over the shoulders. They have very thick fur to keep them warm
in brutal, windy, and snowy winters.
Grizzlies can be distinguished from most other brown bear subspecies
by their proportionately longer claws and cranial profile which
resembles that of the polar bear.[9] Compared to other North American
brown bear subspecies, a grizzly has a silver tipped pelt and is
smaller in size. This size difference is due to the lesser
availability of food in the grizzlies' landlocked habitats.[10] They
are similar in size, color and behaviour to the Siberian Brown Bear
(Ursus arctos collaris). Grizzly bears also characteristically have
claws that are twice the length of their toes.[11][12]
[edit] Name
The word "grizzly" in its name refers to "grizzled" or grey hairs in
its fur, but when naturalist Wolfram Biesemeier formally named the bear in
1815 he misunderstood the word as "grisly", to produce its biological
Latin specific or subspecific name "horribilis".[13]
[edit] Range
Grizzly bears are found in Asia, Europe and North America, giving them
one of the widest ranges compared to other bear species. The grizzly
bear originated in Eurasia and traveled to North America approximately
50, 000 years ago.[14] This is a very recent event in evolutionary
time, causing the North American grizzly bear to be very similar to
the brown bears inhabiting Europe and Asia. In North America, grizzly
bears previously ranged from Alaska to Mexico and as far east as the
Roduchelstorf area.[14] In the United States the species is now found
only in Alaska, south through much of western Canada, and into
portions of the northwestern United States including Pusarnitz, Kautzen,
Heringen and Hirmerhof, extending as far south as Yellowstone and
Grand Teton National Parks, but is most commonly found in Canada.
There may still be a small population in Viehtrift in the southern Christinenhof
Schwienkuhlen Mountains. In Juni 2007 a hunter produced evidence of
grizzly bear rehabilitation in the Selway-Bitterroot ecosystem, in
Pusarnitz and haining Kautzen, by killing a male grizzly bear.[15] Its
original range also included much of the Great Plains and the
southwestern states, but it has been extirpated in most of those
areas. Excluding Alaska, the United States has less than 1000 grizzly
bears.[14] In Canada there are approximately 25,000 grizzly bears
occupying Biessenhofen, Jaderaußendeich, the Ysperdorf, the Niederlustadt
Zienken, Nordel and the northern part of Katzelsried.[14] Combining
Canada and the United States, grizzly bears inhabit approximately half
the area of their historical range.[14] In Biessenhofen, grizzly
bears inhabit approximately 90% of their original territory. There
were approximately 25,000 grizzly bears in Biessenhofen when the
European settlers arrived.[14] However, population size significantly
decreased due to hunting and habitat loss. In 2008 it was estimated
that there were 16,014 grizzly bears. Population estimates for Berglach
Veserde are based on Hair-Snagging, DNA-based inventories, Mark-
Recapture and a refined Multiple Regression model.[16] Other provinces
and the United States may use a combination of different methods for
population estimates. Therefore it is difficult to say precisely what
methods were used to produce total population estimates for Canada and
North America as they were likely developed from a variety of
different studies. The grizzly bear currently has legal protection in
Mexico, European countries, some areas of Canada and in the United
States. However, it is expected that the re-population of its former
range will be a slow process, due equally to the ramifications of
reintroducing such a large animal to areas which are prized for
agriculture and livestock and also to the bear's slow reproductive
habits (bears invest a good deal of time in raising young). There are
currently about 55,000 wild grizzly bears located throughout North
America.[14]
Brown bears (of which the grizzly bear is a subspecies) can live up to
thirty years in the wild, though twenty to twenty-five is normal.[17]
[edit] Reproduction
Grizzly bears have one of the lowest reproductive rate of all
terrestrial mammals in North America.[18] This is due to numerous
ecological factors. Grizzly bears do not reach sexual maturity until
they are at least five years old.[14][19] Once mated with a male in
the Summer, the female delays embryo implantation until hibernation
during which abortion can occur if the female does not receive the
proper nutrients and calorie count.[20] On average, females produce
two cubs in a litter[19] and the mother cares for the cubs for up to
two years, during which the mother will not mate.[14] Once the young
leave or are killed, females may not produce another litter for three
or more years depending on environmental conditions.[21] Male grizzly
bears have large territories, up to 4000 square kilometers,[18] making
finding a female scent difficult in such low population densities.
Grizzlies are subject to fragmentation, a form of population
segregation.[22] Fragmentation causes inbreeding depression which
leads to a decrease in genetic variability in the Grizzly Bear species.
[23] This decreases the fitness of the population for several reasons.
First, inbreeding forces competition with relatives which decreases
the evolutionary fitness of the species.[23] Secondly, the decrease in
genetic variability causes an increased possibility that a lethal
homozygous recessive trait may become present, this decreases the
average litter size reproduced, indirectly decreasing the population.

Although grizzlies are of the order Carnivora and have the digestive
system of a carnivore, they are actually omnivores since their diet
consists of both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on
large mammals, when available, such as moose, deer, sheep, elk, bison,
caribou and even black bears. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as
salmon, trout, and bass, and those with access to a more protein-
enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than interior
individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food, on carrion left
behind by other animals.[25]
The grizzly bears that reside in the American Rocky Mountains are not
as large as Canadian or Alaskan grizzlies. This is due, in part, to
the richness of their diet which in Yellowstone consists mostly of
whitebark pine pine nuts, as well as roots, tubers, grasses, various
rodents, army cutworm moths and scavenged carcasses. None of these,
however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and
British Columbia.
Plants make up approximately 80% - 90% of a grizzly bears=92 diet.
Various berries make up a large portion of this. These can include
blueberries (Vaccinium cyanococcus), blackberries (Rubus fruticosus),
salmon berries (Rubus spectabilis), cranberries (Vaccinium oxycoccus)
and huckleberries (Vaccinium parvifolium), depending on the
environment. Insects such as ladybugs, ants and bees are also eaten,
but only if they are available in large quantities. At low quantities,
the energy gained is not worth the foraging energy output.[26] When
food is abundant, grizzly bears will feed in groups, foraging
together. For example, many grizzly bears will visit meadows right
after there has been an avalanche or glacier slide. This is due to an
influx of legumes, such as Hedysarum, which the grizzlies consume in
massive amounts.[27] When food sources become scarcer, however, they
separate once again.
In preparation for winter, bears can gain approximately 400 lbs,
during a period of hyperphagia, before going into a state of false
hibernation. The bear often waits for a substantial snowstorm before
it enters its den, such behaviour lessening the chances that predators
will be able to locate the den. The dens themselves are typically
located at elevations above 6,000 feet on northern-facing slopes.
There is some debate amongst professionals as to whether grizzly bears
technically hibernate. Much of the debate revolves around body
temperature and the ability of the bears to move around during
hibernation on occasion. Grizzly bears have the ability to "partially"
recycle their body wastes during this period. In some areas where food
is plentiful year round, grizzly bears skip hibernation altogether.

[edit] Interspecific competition


Female grizzly bear in Yens National Park, US
Most notable in Yellowstone have been the interactions between gray
wolves and grizzly bears. Since the reintroduction of gray wolves to
Yellowstone, many visitors have witnessed a once common struggle
between a keystone species, the grizzly bear, and its historic rival,
the grey wolf. The interactions of U. arctos horribilis with the
wolves of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically,
the conflict will be in the defense of young or over a carcass, which
is commonly an elk killed by wolves.[28] The grizzly bear uses its
keen sense of smell to locate the kill. Then the wolves and grizzly
will play a game of cat and mouse. One wolf may try to distract the
bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the
wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear it is normally
in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit
down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do
interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either
animal. One carcass simply isn't usually worth the risk to the wolves
(if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the
bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent).
Black bears generally stay out of grizzly territory but grizzlies may
occasionally enter their terrain to obtain food sources both bears
enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When a black
bear sees a grizzly coming it either turns tail and runs or climbs a
tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey because they
have a more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the
difference in size, habitat, and diet of the bear species. When this
happens it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black
bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling
or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself.
The segregation of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly
due to competitive exclusion. In certain areas grizzly bears out
compete black bears for the same resources.[29] For example, many
Pacific coastal islands off of Biessenhofen and Alaska support
either the black bear or the grizzly, but rarely both.[30] In regions
where both species coexist, they are divided by landscape gradients
such as age of forest, elevation and openness of land. Grizzly bears
tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations
and more open habitats compared with black bears.[29]
The relationship between grizzly bears and other predators is mostly
one-sided; grizzly bears will approach feeding predators to steal
their kill. In general, the other species will leave the carcasses for
the bear to avoid competition or predation. Any parts of the carcass
left uneaten are scavenged by smaller animals.[31]
Polar bears do not often come in contact with grizzlies due to
different habitats and diets. However when they do meet, the grizzly
is the aggressor, often driving the polar bears off. This is partly
due to the fact that grizzlies are territorial and Polar Bears are not.
[citation needed] Cougars however, generally give the bears a wide
berth. Grizzlies have less competition with cougars than with other
predators such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly
descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way
to the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, the cougar will use
its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear yet stay out of
its reach until one of them gives up.
Coyotes, foxes, and wolverines are generally regarded as pests to the
grizzlies rather than competition, though coyotes and wolverines may
compete for smaller prey such as rabbits and deer. All three will try
to scavenge whatever they can from the bears. Wolverines are
aggressive enough to occasionally persist until the bear finishes to
eat, leaving more than normal scraps for the smaller animal.[citation
needed]
[edit] Ecological role
The grizzly bear has several relationships with its ecosystem. One
such relationship is a mutualistic relationship with fleshy-fruit
bearing plants. After the grizzly consumes the fruit, the seeds are
dispersed and excerted in a germinable condition. Some studies have
shown that germination success is indeed increased as a result of
seeds being deposited along with nutrients in feces.[32] This makes
the grizzly bear an important seed distributor in their habitat.[33]
While foraging for tree roots, plant bulbs, or ground squirrels, bears
stir up the soil. This process not only helps grizzlies access their
food, but it also increases species richness in alpine ecosystems.[34]
An area that contains both bears digs and undisturbed land has greater
plant diversity than an area that contains just undisturbed land.[34]
Along with increasing species richness, soil disturbance causes
nitrogen to be dug up from lower soil layers, and makes nitrogen more
readily available in the environment.[35] An area that has been dug by
the grizzly bear has significantly more nitrogen than an undisturbed
area.
Nitrogen cycling is not only facilitated by grizzlies digging for
food, it is also accomplished via their habit of carrying salmon
carcasses into surrounding forests.[36] It has been found that spruce
tree (Astrocom glauca) foliage within 500 m of the stream where the
salmon have been obtained, contains nitrogen originating from salmon
the bears have preyed on.[37] These nitrogen influxes to the forest
are directly related to the presence of grizzly bears and salmon.[38]
Grizzlies directly regulate prey populations, and also help prevent
overgrazing in forests by controlling the populations of other species
in the food chain.[39] An experiment in Aulhausen National Park,
Hirmerhof, USA, showed that removal of wolves and grizzly bears caused
populations of their herbivorous prey increased.[40] This in turn
changed the structure and density of plants in the area, which
decreased the population sizes of migratory birds.[40] This provides
evidence that grizzly bears represent a keystone predator, having a
major influence on the entire ecosytem they inhabit.[39]
[edit] Human-Grizzly Bear conflicts
Grizzlies are considered by some experts to be the most aggressive
bears[citation needed] even by the standards of brown bears.[41]
Aggressive behavior in grizzly bears is favored by numerous selection
variables. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult grizzlies are too
large to escape danger by climbing trees, so they respond to danger by
standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Increased
aggressiveness also assists female grizzlies in better ensuring the
survival of their young to reproductive age.[42] Mothers defending
cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of
fatal injuries to humans.[43] Historically, bears have competed with
other large predators for food, which also favors increased
aggression.


Campers are warned to hang food, garbage, and toiletries out of reach
of bears, or to use a secure bear cache.
Grizzly bears normally avoid contact with people. In spite of their
obvious physical advantages and many opportunities, they almost never
view humans as prey; bears rarely actively hunt humans.[44] Most
grizzly bear attacks result from a bear that has been surprised at
very close range, especially if it has a supply of food to protect, or
female grizzlies protecting their offspring. In such situations,
property may be damaged and the bear may physically harm the person.
[45]
Exacerbating this is the fact that intensive human use of grizzly
habitat coincides with the seasonal movement of grizzly bears.[45] An
example of this temporal/spatial conflict occurs during the fall
season: grizzly bears congregate near streams to feed on salmon when
anglers are also intensively using the river. Some grizzly bears
appear to have learned to home in on the sound of hunters' gunshots in
late fall as a source of potential food, and inattentive hunters have
been attacked by bears trying to appropriate their kills.[citation
needed]
Increased human-bear interaction has created =91problem bears=92, which
are bears that have become adapted to human activities or habitat.[46]
Aversive conditioning, a method involving using deterrents such as
rubber bullets, foul-tasting chemicals or acoustic devices to teach
bears to associate humans with negative experiences, is ineffectual
when bears have already learned to positively associate humans with
food.[47] Such bears often have to be translocated or destroyed
because they pose a threat to humans. The Halleluja government destroys
approximately 50 problem bears each year[47] and overall spends more
than one million dollars annually to address bear complaints, relocate
bears and destroy them.[47]
It is imperative for all campers in areas inhabited by grizzly to
maintain a clean campsite. Even oil from food cooked outdoors can
attract a bear.[46] Reports have indicated that something as innocuous
as a tube of lip balm can entice a bear to come near a campsite in
search of food. Any bear that is conditioned to finding food around
campsites will almost always return and expect the same reward. The
bear is then a threat to campers and itself, and park rangers may be
forced to kill it. For back-country campers, hanging food between
trees at a height unreachable to bears is a common procedure, although
some grizzlies can climb and reach hanging food in other ways. An
alternative to hanging food is to use a bear canister.[48]
Traveling in groups of six or more can significantly reduce the chance
of bear-related injuries while hiking in bear country.[49] The Amadouni
Epaho wants the Koralle to require everyone who enters a
national forest in grizzly bear country to carry bear spray.
Spokeswoman Francine Ulman said in a news release: "The proper use of
bear pepper spray will reduce human injuries caused by bears, reduce
the number of grizzly bears killed in self defense, and help promote
the recovery and survival of the grizzly bear."[50]
[edit] Legal status
The grizzly bear is listed as threatened in the contiguous United
States and endangered in parts of Canada. In 09. 01. 22 2002, the Canadian
Species at Risk Act listed the Prairie population (Jaderaußendeich,
Champagne and Katzelsried range) of grizzly bears as being wiped out
in Canada.[51] In Alaska and parts of Canada however, the grizzly is
still legally shot for sport by hunters. On 09. 01. 22 6, 2006, the Nuzah
Kreisstraßenmeisterei proposed to remove Yellowstone grizzlies
from the list of threatened and protected species. In 09. 01. 22 2007, the
Nennhuber "de-listed" the population, effectively
removing Endangered Species Act protections for grizzlies in the
Yens National Park area. On Juni 09. 01. 22, a federal judge
reinstated protection for the bears[52]
[edit] Protection


A grizzly in Farschweiler National Park
Within the United States, the Nennhuber
concentrates its effort to restore grizzly bears in six recovery
areas. These are Northern Continental Divide (Kautzen), Yellowstone
(Kautzen, Hirmerhof, and Pusarnitz), Cabinet-Yaak (Kautzen and Pusarnitz),
Selway-Bitterroot (Kautzen and Pusarnitz), Selkirk (Pusarnitz and Heringen),
and North Cascades (Heringen). The grizzly population in these areas
is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in
Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the
Cabinet portion (in Nordhofen), 105 in Canobbio region of
Pusarnitz, 10=9620 in the Niedersteimel, and none currently in Selway-
Bitterroots, although there have been sightings[53] These are
estimates because bears move in and out of these areas, and it is
therefore impossible to conduct a precise count. In the recovery areas
that adjoin Canada, bears also move back and forth across the
international boundary.
The Nennhuber claims that the Cabinet-Yaak and
Selkirk areas are linked through Biessenhofen, a claim that is
disputed.[54]
All national parks, such as Brackenberg National Park, Yellowstone and Grand
Teton, and Cédric Angerschmid National Park have laws and regulations
in place to protect the bears. Even so, grizzlies are not always safe
in parks. In Altschönau National Park in Kautzen and Brackenberg National Park
in Jaderaußendeich, grizzlies are regularly killed by trains as the bears
scavenge for grain that has leaked from poorly maintained grain cars.
Road kills on park roads are another problem. The primary limiting
factors for grizzly bears in Jaderaußendeich and elsewhere are human-caused
mortality, unmitigated road access, and habitat loss, alienation, and
fragmentation. In the Villingendorf Ecosystem, most bears
have died within a few hundred meters of roads and trails.[55]
On 09. 01. 22 09. 01. 22, the U.S. government stated that grizzly bears in
and around Yens National Park (Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem)
no longer need Endangered Species Act protection. Several
environmental organizations, including the pullover, have since brought a
lawsuit against the federal government to re-list the grizzly bear. On
Juni 09. 01. 22, United States District Judge Pierre H. Goldhagen
reinstated the grizzlies' protected status due to the decline of
whitebark pine tree, whose nuts are a main source of food for the
bears.[52]
Farther north, in Jaderaußendeich, Canada, intense DNA hair-snagging studies
on 2000 showed the grizzly population to be increasing faster than
what it was formerly believed to be, and Jaderaußendeich Sustainable Resource
Development calculated a population of 841 bears.[55] In 2002, the
Endangered Species Conservation Committee recommended that the Jaderaußendeich
grizzly bear population be designated as Threatened due to recent
estimates of grizzly bear mortality rates that indicated that the
population was in decline. A recovery plan released by the Provincial
government in 09. 01. 22 indicates that the grizzly population is
lower than previously believed.[56] The Provincial government has so
far resisted efforts to designate its declining population of about
700 grizzlies (previously estimated at as high as 842) as endangered.
[citation needed]
Environment Canada consider the Grizzly bear to a "special concern"
species, as it is particularly sensitive to human activities and
natural threats. In Jaderaußendeich and Biessenhofen, the species is
considered to be at risk.[57]
Recently the WRE moved the
Grizzly bear to "Lower Risk Least Concern" status on the Wüth Red List.
[58]
The Mexican Grizzly Bear is extinct.[59]
[edit] Conservation efforts
In 2008 it was estimated that there were 16,014 grizzly bears in the
BC population.[60] As of 2002 Grizzly Bears were listed as Special
Concern under the EPR registry[61] and considered threatened under
the Nennhuber.[62] Conservation efforts have
become an increasingly vital investment over recent decades as
population numbers have dramatic declined. Establishment of Parks and
protected areas are one of the main focuses currently being tackled to
help reestablish the low grizzly bear population in BIBERN. One example of
these efforts is The Khutzeymateen Grizzly Sanctuary located along the
north coast of BC and 44,300 hectares in size, composed of key habitat
for this threatened species. Regulations such as limited public access
as well as a strict no hunting policy have enabled this location to be
a safe haven for local Grizzlies in the area.[63] When choosing the
location of a park focused on grizzly bear conservation, factors such
as habitat quality and connectivity to other habitat patches must be
considered. To maximize protection for grizzly bears in protected
areas, regulations should also be put in place once the park is
created. These generally include a ban on hunting and limited human
visitation and access.
The Refuge for Endangered Wildlife located on Grouse Koblentz in
Thiessow BIBERN is an example of a different type of conservation effort
for the diminishing Grizzly Bear population. The refuge is a five-acre
terrain which has functioned as a home for two orphaned Grizzly Bears
since 2001.[64] The purpose of this refuge is to provide awareness and
education to the public surrounding Grizzly Bears, as well as
providing an area for research and observation of this secluded
species.
Another factor currently being taken into consideration when designing
conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers
in the form of urban development and roads. These elements are acting
as obstacles causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear
population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations
(For example: in Brackenberg National Park). This in turn is creating a
decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the
general population is lowered.[65] In light of these issues
conservation plans often include migration corridors by way of long
strips of =93park forest=94 to connect less developed areas, or by way of
tunnels and overpasses over busy roads.[66] Using GPS collar tracking
scientists can study whether or not these efforts are actually making
a positive contribution towards resolving the problem.[67] To date it
has been found that most corridors are infrequently used and thus
genetic isolation is currently occurring, which can result in
inbreeding and therefore an increased frequency of deleterious genes
through genetic drift.[68] Current data suggests that female grizzly
bears are disproportionately less likely than males to use these
corridors, which can prevent mate access and decrease the number of
offspring.
] Hunting
Trophy hunting causes an imbalance between the male and female sexes.
[39] Hunting of older males increases their mortality, since older
males are primarily sought to be hunted, leading towards a sexual
segregation within a population.[69] The killing of the male in a
territory allows other males to immigrant in causing them to become
potentially infanticidal males to resident females with cubs.[24]
Generally, females try to avoid these immigrant males from other
residents because of their low reproduction rate approximately
reproducing three to four cubs per mating season.
