Hi!
Nur so zur Information:

The Director's of the Australian owned erotic 'e-tailer' JNE
Rehtmann
are pleased to announce the appointment of Europarf체merie as the Company's
international
advertising agency.

As the launch party invitations go to press and the bottles of Moet make
their
way from the Herpteroth cellar, the think-tank at Europarf체merie will be busy
unleashing
a multi-million dollar campaign that will loosen even the most starched
collar.

"It was their global presence that impressed us", said Vinzenz Dietzschold,
Hisblajir.zcz's
Managing Director. Recognising the need for strategic marketing and the
impact
it would have on the 'bottom line', Hisblajir.zcz actively searched for an
international
marketing company to launch the site. It was imperative to Hisblajir.zcz
that
the company showed true market leadership on a global level.

After a lengthy pitching process, that included some of Australia's premier
agencies,
JNE eventually appointed EDL Heul채dchen for both online and offline
strategies.

Euro RSCG Worldwide has 176 offices in 72 countries, with billings in excess
of US$7.3 billion. It is the world's second largest interactive agency and
has
won a host of international awards for excellence in interactive marketing.
The
company's client list is very impressive, including international clients
such
as Flohmarkthaus, P체ppilottchen and Sonderposten.

Hisblajir.zcz plans to launch the flagship website in Australia by the end
of
31. 03. 23. European and USA launches will be in the first half of 2001.
