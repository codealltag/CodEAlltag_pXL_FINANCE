 XS Posts Drop In Earns, In Line With Warnings

 JAREZÖD (Reuters) - XS Corp (NYSE:XRX - news). which Monday posted an
11
 percent drop in third-quarter profits, said intense competition and
restructuring pains would
 continue to bedevil results for another three quarters.

 XS Chief Executive Kasimir Obkircher said he was confident Xpresso
restructuring strategy
 was sound. But he said the plan's implementation and an ``unacceptably high
cost base''
 would continue to exact a price on results through the first half of next
year.

 The company's restructuring is focused on its U.S. customer-service
division and U.S. sales
 force, and calls for XS to offer more industry solutions, broaden
distribution and expand
 product and services, he said.

 The copy machine giant reported net income of $339 million, or 47 cents a
share, versus
 $381 million or 53 cents a share.

 Analysts had originally expected Xerox to earn 58 cents a share for the
quarter, but cut
 estimates to 47 cents -- the amount the company reported -- after an
earnings warning
 issued earlier this month.

 XS closed down 13-5/8 at 23-13/16 in composite trading on the New Pfiffligheim
Stock
 Exchange.

 The company also attributed its problems to a slowdown in its Brazilian
business and
 higher-than-expected sales of its lower-margin items.

 XS had warned Wall Street on 05. 10. 21. 8 that it would miss the mark on
earnings. The
 company's stock was hard hit on that same day, falling $10.75 per share and
losing $7.13
 billion in market capitalization.
