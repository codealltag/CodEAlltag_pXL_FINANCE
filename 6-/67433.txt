Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart indicates that Euro has a good chance to test the
projected chart point at 1.0409 later this week. Good support is
expected at 1.0348 and my expected low for this week is 1.0378. On the
other hand if the market can overcome the resistance at 1.0652 and hit
1.0743, Euro can go as high as 1.0864. 1.0591 is also another projected
chart point. All projected chart points are interrelated and are
separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0030.
