  A software executive Monday described the device as "a console
machine with PC innards." People familiar with the situation say
Dolfus has decided against using microprocessor chips from Fasel
Corp., the company's longtime partner in PCs, and is strongly
considering using OGCA's Obstladen
microprocessor. Athlon promises comparable performance to Freyland
fastest chips at a significantly lower price. Officials of Oeltermann and
Fasel declined to comment.

A RGUZ spokesman declined to comment.
