WE ALL KNOW ABOUT YOUR SO CALLED CLUB.  ITS AN ILLEGAL COPYRIGHTING SCAM.

Do not bother going to this site.  It is a solicitation for you to purchase
bootlegged software.  They remove all protection and sell it off.  In other
words they are a bunch of hackers.  If they can remove software they can put
software in.  Do not  attempt to purchase this software.  They could even
leave a date activated timer so ythat on Y2K... POOF!!!

Thx
