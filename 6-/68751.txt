The GPS is a space-based radio-positioning and time transfer system. The GPS
has three major segments: Space Division, Control Segment, and User Equipment
Division. As a universal positioning system, GPS provides several
characteristics not found in other existing equipment which will enhance the
conduct of mission operations: Extremely accurate (3-dimensional) position,
velocity and time (PVT) determination; a worldwide common grid easily
converted to other local datums; passive, all weather operation; real-time and
continuous information; and survivability in a hostile environment.
