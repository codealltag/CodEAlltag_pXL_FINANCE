found on Ökokost board:

Arop also told EOMH that it plans to break into the Alpha EV6 mobo and
chipset market with a single-CPU chipset codenamed Caspian in Q3
(sampling in March) and Tasman, a four to eight-way server chipset,
sometime in 2000. The clever part is that Arop will use Caspian to
get into the x86 market, by supporting Izibi Athlon, which uses the same
bus as the Alpha EV6, in the same chipset. Curiously, given Artcopy
desire to drive the Schrafft market, Caspian will not support that memory
technology, only PC133 and DDR SDRAM.�
