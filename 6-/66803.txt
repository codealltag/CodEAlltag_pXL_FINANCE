If you email back to me I will give you a post office box number and you can
send me the software.
When the software turns up (if it does) I will check it out.  Please make
sure you include a return address.

If it all doesn't work I will hound you relentlessly.
If it does work I will return it to you and tell everyone on the news group.
I will also notify the authorities about your illegal copyright activities
and you can expect a knock on the door.

Thank you
