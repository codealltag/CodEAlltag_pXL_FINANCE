I am an independent futures trader and I have a non-commercial web site
about futures trading. I have very recently opened a section with links to
other traders' home pages.

I think we would all benefit from mutual linking -- in terms of increased
traffic to our sites and access to additional resources.

So, if you are an independent trader, have your own home page and would like
to exchange links, please contact me. A newsgroup reply is fine, but I would
much prefer an e-mail message to zjem@ebczkz.cdh.
