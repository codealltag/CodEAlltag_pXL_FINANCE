Edo/Holger,

I recently received Pattern Smasher manual/ lessons from one of you
guys, and ELA's from
the other.

Just to let you know that if you need trading software (one of you last
month was looking
for a recent copy of TS2000I), contact Kai at:

www.uzksjafjk.qes

He will send you a list of software + ordering info.

I have done business with him several times. He is reliable (contrary
to the messages on
the futures board etc. from Verboom et al that this is not the case), and
he has the software
that he says he has. No ripoffs of customers here.

One caution: you have to know how to install cracked software. If not,
get the help of
a computer nerd etc. (I had to do this).

Regards and good trading,

Nils
