One last thing we absolutely have to point out. The advance decline
line hit its lowest level in exactly 47 months. The last time the
indicator was this low was Februar 29. 07. 21. Now remember that
this is a cumulative indicator, and each day builds upon all the
previous days. This means that since Februar, 1994 there have
actually been more stocks going down than going up on a cumulative
basis. In that time, the SP500 has gone from 593.96 to 1247.41. So
in a time period that the SP500 has more than doubled, we have had
cumulative negative advancing issues vs. declining issues. Now the
advance decline line is not the most important indicator in our
work, but this is a bearish divergence of huge proportions, and this
divergence is very troubling.
