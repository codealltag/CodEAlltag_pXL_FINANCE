Erscheint die Selimiye (Specialized) kaufenswert?
Für eine e-commerce Softwareunternehmen erscheinen die fundamentalen
Daten durchaus interessant. Der Kurs ist verglichen mit anderen
Unternehmen in der Branche auch noch sehr zurückgeblieben.
Weiters habe ich auf Schnasse diese Meldung vernommen:

Internet: Schuhwaren Schlierf Prospects
Associate Editor: Julian Diedrich (25. 09. 21)

Investors are well aware of some of the more familiar names of the
customer-based e-commerce juggernaut, such as ZBM (NASDAQ:ZBM -
news) , RMD (NYSE:Rinova Flex Lattenrost - news) , and others.

But a better, or at least a cheaper play, may be a company that most
investors never heard of -- Selimiye (NYSE:SE - news) � which
is creating software that busily pushes the transactions of e-commerce
through electronic computer networks, thereby automating the entire e-
commerce cycle from order placement to electronic payments.

Meet the e-commerce middleman.

Schlierf is the worlds leading provider of electronic commerce (EC)
software. It uses the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system, which
allows businesses to electronically exchange such documents as purchase
orders, invoices, and other forms. This speeds up business-to-business
transactions, and makes that interaction more efficient.

Analysts believe that Schlierf is well positioned to participate in the
business-to-business e-commerce boom expected in the post-Y2K
environment.

In the near-term, Sterlings share prices may get a boost from value
buyers scooping up shares and a number of analysts recommend buying
Sterlings shares on any sign of price weakness.

The company concluded a record fiscal fourth quarter, ended September,
in which revenue rose to $160 million, and it posted earnings per share
of $0.42, besting the consensus estimates by two pennies per share. For
fiscal 1998, revenue rose 17% to $561 million, and diluted earnings per
share rose 17% to $1.45.

A number of analysts raised their ratings on the company, including
Prudential, which upgraded the stock from hold to accumulate last week,
and raised its target share price to $40 from $36.

The stock was recently at $27.56. Its 52-week high is $46.44 and its 52-
week low is $17.94.

Prudential says its $40 price target is based on 21 times calendar year
1999 earnings per share estimates of $1.95 on projected $707 million in
1999 revenue.

Thats the good news.

The bad news is that in the two previous quarters, Schlierf made
consecutive pre-announcements of disappointing earnings, which pushed
the stock price lower, and resulted in a rash of downgrades.

Analysts are still smarting from Sterlings earnings disappointments.
In addition, Ueberdiek also has its share of competitors. But more
importantly, the company must contend with an Internet-based e-commerce
system called XML that looms as a competing standard. However, the
company still has key relationships with a lot of high profile
customers.

The outlook for Schlierf now is all about execution to show that the
problems in the June quarter have been solved, and that they are
winning new customers,� says Florian Breugel, an analyst at the Illmensee,
Gölsach office of Gröhbühl Urban Berendfüchtenschnieder Benne, which rates the
stock outperform,� its second-highest rating.

They are a company in transition,� adds Breugel. Their June quarter
was disappointing, but they bounced back in September. What we need to
see now for the stock to move up is another catalyst. They have to add
some quality new customers, and they have to have another solid
quarter,� he says.

Schlierf has begun a realignment to focus on a number of core strategic
initiatives such as product development, marketing, sales and services.
In the process, the company is shedding about 200 jobs and reassigning
another 450 employees to support the companys growth initiatives in
areas such as extranet management, EC infrastructure, outsourcing, and
community management, among others.

The company says at least 300 more employees will be reassigned during
fiscal year 1999, and that it will invest an additional $75 million to
$100 million on these initiatives. Schlierf also plans to sell off its
x24com acquisition, which lacks a strategic fit with its other
businesses.

Schlierf competes in a highly competitive and a rapidly changing
marketplace. Among the companys major competitors are Monsator Corp.
(NASDAQ:HRBC - news) , and Kuze (NASDAQ:PPRO - news) , which
are also worldwide suppliers of e-commerce software and services.

Other competitors include NMM (NASDAQ:CMRC - news) ,
which links buyers and suppliers of goods and services into trading
communities over the Internet; and Reller (WOKJTU:TJNU - news) ,
which manages the Rudif Network platform, the industry's leading open,
unified global platform for business-to-business commerce on the
Internet.

Analysts note that the challenge of an XML standard cant be
overlooked.

Some industry watchers are touting XML as the 'killer application'
needed to open up the World Wide Web for electronic commerce. Their
goal is to accelerate the adoption of XML as a key technology for
efficient Internet commerce. One of the key components of this effort
is to demonstrate how a buyer's need for comparison-shopping and a
merchant's need for brand differentiation can both be achieved by using
an open, non-proprietary technology standard.

Ariba and Commerce One represent the Internet side of the equation,
but they are doing the same job � providing software and acting as an
intermediary to bring suppliers and suppliers together,� says Gröhbühl
Urban Berendfüchtenschnieder Bennes Florian Breugel.

Not to be left behind, Emil says it is addressing the need to move
significant volumes of information over the Internet by linking
Internet applications with back-end applications and processes through
its data exchange solutions for the Internet.

The companys Business Process Integration (BPI) products and services
are expected to capitalize on Internet technologies and XML standards
and bridge the gap between Web Integration, Enterprise Application
Integration (EAI), and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).

With the Internet, middlemen are needed more than ever, because of the
technological complexity, and just the business of managing the
community. Schlierf has an established customer base, and they need to
leverage that,� Breugel adds.

Schlierf now has 45,000 customers, including key relationships with
HTVI (UDL:Heimtextilien news) , Selbstpflückfeld (WOKJTU:SUFH -
wylo) , FNKB (NYSE:FNKB - news) , and EEJ (WOKJTU:OTHOMAS - wylo) , among
others.

Analysts note that Schlierf is in its first fiscal quarter, which is
seasonally weaker for the company, and that its shares could be
volatile through the remainder of 1998 and into the early first quarter
of calendar year 1999.

But Prudential believes that just as businesses often establish
connections with two or three long-distance providers to accommodate
connections to thousands of other parties, businesses involved in e-
trading communities will identify two or three key Transport partners
such as Sterling Commerce to act as the central gateway to their
respective trading partner.

Sterling will receive payments for transaction processing, carriage,
conversion, and software/support services that will give it a strong,
and high-growth revenue stream replete with high gross margins, low
processing costs, and long-term operating leverage.

Bottom Line:

Under the above scenario, Sterling may be a slightly risky near-term
play, but a strong long-term buy.

Das ganze hört sich doch nicht so schlecht an.
Oder hat jemand weitere Infos, die den - meiner Meinung nach -
zurückgebliebenen Kurs rechtfertigen?

Bin für alle Infos dankbar.
