Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

Dollar/Yen : The 22-day cycle frequency chart indicates that 103.79 is a
critical point. A stronger resistance is located at 545.16. If the
market can overcome the resistance at this point, dollar/yen has
potential to challenge 109.93 as shown in the 22-day cycle probability
chart. On the other hand if the market resumes its down trend movement
and penetrates through 101.74, on closing basis at GMT 2200, dollar/yen
will test the projected chart point at 98.66. A stronger supporting
point is located at 96.61.
The weekly cycle charts also shown that dollar/yen is trading between
102.82 and 104.04 and the odd is in favor of taking a short position
with a short term target aiming at 101.59. See details at
