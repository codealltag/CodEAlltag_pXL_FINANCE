Who can believe it?

Software theives pirating software are offering Christmas special specials.

Don't bother with these guys.  Plenty of people email me privately and
advice how money went off and nothing came back.  Others actually post  and
make public confession.  (they realised they were cheating the software
manufacturer and in turn got ripped off)

Software thieves have no conscience.

Thx.  Leave these guys well alon.

Bye
