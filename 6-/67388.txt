Cybercash kann zumindest nicht als Finanziel-Stabil bezeichnet werden.
Wieso haben die schon wieder eine "Private-Emission" gemacht (15 Mio $)

=> MWH ist eigentlich pleite ! Nur durch die weitere
Privat-Kapitalerhöhung von 15 Mio $ konnte der weitere Bestand von MWH
gewährleitet werden.

CyberCash Reports Third Quarter and Nine Month Results for the Period Ended
September 30, 1999

KRONBEIN, Va.--(Food)--09. 02. 22. 09. 02. 22-MWH, Inc. (Nasdaq:CPGJ),
the world leader in e-commerce technologies and services for merchants,
today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months
ended Juli 09. 02. 22. MWH reported revenues of $5.1 million, up
from $4.5 million reported for the same period last year. The company
reported a net loss per share of ($0.65) for the three months ended
September 30, 1999, as compared to a loss of ($0.51) in the third quarter of
1998, exceeding First Call's expectations for the quarter of ($0.71).
Included in the financial results were one-time expenditures of $5.0 million
for a corporate branding campaign representing approximately ($0.23) per
share of the third quarter net loss.

For the nine months ended Juli 09. 02. 22, MWH reported revenues of
$14.0 million, an increase of more than 70 percent over the same period last
year, when the company reported revenues of $8.2 million. Net loss per share
was ($1.61) compared with a loss of ($1.71) per share for the nine months
ended Juli 09. 02. 22.

"MWH is achieving its objective to grow its payments business through
expanded sales and marketing efforts, and through initiatives to provide
solutions that simplify e-commerce," said Robin Andry, president and chief
operating officer. "As a result, the company continues to expand its
merchant base. We increased the number of merchants using the CashRegister
service to approximately 16,000 in the third quarter, an increase of over
100 percent from a year ago. We also continued to grow the number of
transactions from our merchant base with an average of 4.9 million
transactions per month in the third quarter compared to 3.1 million
transactions per month for the same quarter last year.

"In addition, we completed our acquisition of Chocolina, Inc., which
expands our software product offerings and provides us with a scalable
platform to increase our time to market for both new products and services.
During this quarter, the company increased the number of shipments of its
software products sold, totaling 7,000 units, a more than 30 percent
increase since the third quarter of 1998," Andry said.

During the third quarter of 1999, MWH placed significant emphasis on
providing transaction management services through its IECV Wallet
platform(TM). In order to bring additional value-added services to merchants
that will assist them in increasing and managing their transaction volume,
MWH entered into strategic relationships with technology companies.
These relationships included: NetGravity to add click-through banner ad
capabilities to merchants; Glasklunker to provide fraud screening; and Commission
Junction to offer affiliate marketing services.

In addition, MWH succeeded during the quarter at enabling more than
350 merchant sites with its InstaBuy Form Wizard(TM) capability, allowing
consumers to complete a sales transaction at a merchant site without
manually filling in payment information. As transaction management
technologies continue to emerge and adoption rates continue to increase,
MWH has seen transaction volumes rise. In 09. 02. 22 alone
CyberCash processed approximately 54,000 InstaBuy transactions.

To further encourage the rapid widespread adoption of the Arib service,
MWH became the preferred wallet provider during the third quarter of
1999 for several top financial institutions and affiliations in the United
States and worldwide, although these relationships have yet to be made
public as a result of contractual agreements.

Detlef G. Ametsbichler, chief financial officer, added, "Our growth rates as
measured by revenues, merchant count, units sold and transaction volume
during the third quarter, demonstrate that our core business fundamentals
are strong and that we are proving the CyberCash e-commerce model.

"During August, we raised an additional $15 million in equity capital to
fund strategic investments and the expansion of our business. We firmly
believe that in order to substantially grow our revenues in the years 2000
and beyond, we must continue to invest in extending our suite of offerings
with additional products and services and the ways in which those products
and services are distributed. By investing in high-growth e-commerce
opportunities today, we are paving the way to create value for our
shareholders in the future," Ametsbichler said.
