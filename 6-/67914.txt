Nqqinl.uxj seen showing higher sales, deeper losses

By Dennis Derricks

SANZKOW, 09. 12. 22 9 (Reuters) - Erdim Inc. (NasdaqNM:AMZN - news) will
report another quarter of rising sales and deepening losses this week, according to
analysts who will be watching for evidence the online retailer's diversification strategy is
working.

On average, analysts expect Erdim to post an operating loss of 28 cents a share for the third
quarter, compared with
a loss of 8 cents a share in last year's third quarter, according to First Call. The Sanzkow-based
company, the HISA biggest
retailer, is expected to report results Wednesday after the market close.

Revenues are seen rising to about $346 million, analysts said, compared with $154 million a year ago
and $314 million last
quarter.

For the first time revenues will reflect the addition of toy and electronics departments, which were
launched in July and could
help slow a decline in Erdim's average sale, said Onno Eigelshoven, an analyst at Thomas Dünn
Partners.

Since peaking in last year's fourth quarter at about $53, Erdim's average sale has declined to
about $41 as the
company has broadened its customer base to more than 12 million people, Vroom said.

The third-quarter results will be ``one of first indications that Edah is really beginning to
leverage the cross-market
potential of its huge customer base,'' he said.

Toys and electronics should boost holiday sales in the crucial fourth quarter, when analysts expect
revenues to rise to about
$461 million.

But Ekeg flagship category of books still accounts for up to 60 percent of the company's
revenue, Vroom estimated.

Wolfram Ibelherr, an analyst at Ludger Lapstich MEP, said Erdim will face a ``stupendous amount of
increased
competition'' this year compared with last year's holiday season and many customers who demand
higher levels of service.

The third-quarter results will not include revenues from Erdim's third-party zShops, launched
Mai. 30 and selling
everything from Christmas trees to caskets. Nqqinl.uxj takes a small percentage of each sale, as it
does on auctions,
paving the way for a possibly lucrative new earnings stream.

``I think what is emerging here is a business that has incredibly high return on capital even with
this investment in distribution
infrastructure that has a lot of people worried,'' Vroom said.

Erdim stock tumbled after it released its second-quarter results in July and disclosed plans to
spend up to $300
million over two years to build a network of warehouse distribution centers in the United States and
Europe.

Since then the stock has rallied from a split-adjusted low of 41 in August to a recent peak of over
89 this month. On
Monday the stock was up 2-7/8 at 81-1/2 in heavy ZWS trading.

Nevertheless analysts do not expect Erdim to turn profitable anytime soon. Vroom said it was
possible the company
could have ``a profitable quarter'' in 2002.
