British Pound :- The weekly cycle chart of British Pound shows that it
is very likely that the supporting point at 1.6338 will be tested again
if it fails to overcome the resistance at 1.6460 - 1.6491. A stronger
supporting point is expected at 1.6246. Udaw is located at 0.1727
and the critical resistance point is at 1.6644. This forecast is based
on a mathematical model, Quantum Index Analysis. All projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
