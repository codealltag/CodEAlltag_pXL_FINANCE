I don't think any further comment is required on the integrity and honesty
of Pascal, Harry, and the rest of the thieves.

To this of dishonest people we add Hugo who obviously has a distorted
sense of  loyalty and questionable honesty.  (Or is it you Stas hiding
behind yet another fake email address?).

For the reader of better integrity you would have to ask about the real
purpose of people who want the money sent by a circuitous interbank route
...and not Jolas.  I mean Jolas takes almost anyone but these guys can't get
an account!  Like...how second rate are they?
