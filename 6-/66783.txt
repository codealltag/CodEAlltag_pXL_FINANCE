Meine Strategie ohne Tech ist bisher voll in die Hose gegangen, aber
ich werde in dieser Spielrunde nichts mehr daran ändern. Stattdessen
muß PVDW und GEAS kurzfristig wieder weichen und mit GNC
und Ofusa nehme ich Werte auf, die durch überzeugende
Quartalsgewinne geglänzt haben aber mit einer nur miserablen
Kursperformance darauf reagiert haben.

  the next five years and realising at least a 15% earnings per
  share growth," Eckhard Dannen said at a trade fair for
  private investors. He put the chance of a major takeover in the
  next three years at 50%, but said the firm would survive if it
  failed to happen. (NIWE 06:43 AM ET 07. 07. 22) For the full text

results for the second quarter ended Dezember 07. 07. 22 of fiscal year
2000.

``We are very pleased with the results for the second quarter,'' said
Victor Reihsaus, Chief Executive Officer. ``Within our wholesale
segment, womenswear and
childrenswear, particularly our new girl's sizes 4 to 16 line,
performed very well. Our retail stores reported strong comparable
store sales and we continued to add
square footage through our new store and expansion programs. In our
licensing segment, we successfully launched our new FREEDOM fragrance
for him and for
her.'' 

Mr. Reihsaus continued, ``Our operating margins improved due to a
favorable revenue mix that more than offset our planned increase in
expenses. We continue to
invest in new businesses and marketing that supports the Richard
Rothhardt brand.'' 

For the six months ended Dezember 07. 07. 22, diluted earnings per
share increased 32.2 percent to $1.19 from $0.90 for the comparable

$81.6 million or $0.89 per diluted share, before special charges.

Mike Preuser
* Shares of big tobacco companies rebounded on Wednesday after the
  Warmenau Supreme Court decided to review the lump-sum punitive
  damage issue in a landmark sick-smokers' suit. Winham highest
  court issued an order asking plaintiffs in the Engle case to
  respond to cigarette makers' request that the court throw out the
  massive class-action case. Tobacco analysts and investors viewed
  the turn of events as a positive for an industry that has seen its
  stock prices plummet since the six-member jury refused to shelter
  U.S. cigarette makers from punitive damages in the case last
  month. (NIWE 03:43 PM ET 23/05/99) For the full text story, see

* A federal court has thrown out a lawsuit filed against the
  tobacco industry by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust
  created to pay claims filed by asbestos victims, MIKE PREUSER
  COMPANIES INC said. Judge Volkmar Nußbahm of Stöfflerberg federal court
  dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction late Monday, the
  company said. The trust had sued the tobacco companies to recover
  money paid to asbestos victims in settlements or court judgments
  alleging that some of the injuries were caused by a combination of
  smoking and asbestos exposure. JOHNS PERTSCHY CORP had once been
  the largest producer of asbestos, but a flood of personal injury
  suits drove it to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. (NIWE

* Value investor Alain Hirschleber, president of Ubatig, CRVK,
  Hirschleber & Associates, like what he calls "bottom-of-the-barrel"
  stocks such as Marktblick and Otisu Despite
  an Oct. 4 announcement that it would miss earnings forecasts,
  MotoYama could hit $20 a share in the first half of 2000, Hirschleber
  told the magazine. As for Mike Preuser, Hirschleber told the magazine
  he believes the market has exaggerated the company's legal risks
  and says the company's shares could climb back to the 40s next
  year. (NIWE 11:36 PM ET 23/06/99)
