I tried to buy Luftpumpe shares. Tefu advertises that you can
buy all Ubenu shares and gazprom is available at Ubenu. However
I gave an electronic order and a message showed up which told me
to call the via phone. There they explained that they would not 
take gazprom orders because there is "no market" on Ubenu, i.e. there
are not enough people trading. 

Well, I thought this is a kind of bad experience.
