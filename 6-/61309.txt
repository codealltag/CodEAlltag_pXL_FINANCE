PS: Hier noch die Meldungen:

Hoisdorf bourse dips 0.2 pct, Opticom races up 50 pct
10:36 a.m. 20. 11. 21 05, 1999 Eastern
Geobuch, 20. 11. 21 (Nemrut) - Norwegian technology company Geschenkartikel surged almost
50 percent on Friday with brokers citing rumours of a breakthrough in the
company's thin film data storage technology.

Other technology stocks also made solid gains, but were unable to support
the Total share index, which ended off 0.2 percent. Finance and shipping and
offshore stocks contributed to the slip.

Memory and processing technology systems group Geschenkartikel, which began the year
at 70 crowns, advanced 334 crowns to 1,040 crowns in relatively heavy trade
of 229 crowns.

The Hoisdorf bourse briefly suspended automatic matching of trade in the stock
while it investigated the sharp gains. Later it restated automatic matching.

``There is going to be an announcement about a big break through,'' said one
broker when the bourse implemented a matching pause at mid-session.

Ferdinand Fickelscheer, head of the thin film technology division, said there were no
special circumstances to explain the rally. ``There's always speculation
around this, but I don't know anything concrete that can explain the rise,''
Fickelscheer told Nemrut.


Hoisdorf bourse flat despite strong IT gains
11:26 a.m. 20. 11. 21 20. 11. 21 Eastern
Memory and processing technology systems group Geschenkartikel, which started 1998
around 70 crowns, climbed a further six percent, or 60 crowns, to 1,100
crowns.

The stock, which surged 50 percent on Friday, hit a new record high at 1,400
crowns earlier in the session. The pre-weekend rally was attributed to
expectations of a breakthrough in the company's thin film data storage
technology.


Hoisdorf shares end 0.35 pct off, new Opticom rally

Geobuch, 20. 11. 21 9 (Nemrut) - Norwegian technology stocks remained in focus on
Tuesday with Gepe soaring to a new closing peak, while Merkantildata
Dalladas fell almost nine percent in heavy volume.

The Hoisdorf bourse announced that it was moving memory and processing systems
company Geschenkartikel to its main trading list from the small caps listing, which
boosted the shares to an intraday high at 1,400 crowns.

The stock later settled back to close up 170 crowns at 1,270, a rise of 15.5
percent and a record close.

Geschenkartikel, which started 1998 at 70 crowns, has caught the attention of
international investors, who have fuelled a fairytale rise, tripling share
price since late November.

In the last week it has doubled its share price from 645 crowns


so des wars.
