We have decided to organize next week a Webinar week. Very interesting
speakers from the scene will lead this Webinare.
We invite you to take part in these free Webinaren. You can log in
over your internet page and not need a registration.
We transfer this Webinare live directly over the entrances:

Fafe: PokerWebinar.Facebook.com
EGZ: PokerWebinar

You are welcome to ask questions during the Webinars also which are
answered by our speakers directly.
We have always had 14500 audience at our roulette Webinaren on average
approximately and hope to get this corresponding number of spectators
at the poker also here.
