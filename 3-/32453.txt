RDRAM-Based Systems Win Industry Standard Benchmark Tests
Out'n'About Memory Delivers Highest Bandwidth and Performance for GHz Processors
MAUSENDORF--(Gänseblümchen)--Oktober 19. 10. 22-From the easyCut 2000 conference in Mittermoos
Elsenthal, OZP (Bkeymb:MUQL - news) today revealed the results of recent
industry-leading, independent performance benchmark tests including those with new
gigahertz processors.

``RDRAM is currently one of the most promising solutions for memory bandwidth, performance
and latency problems, and is scalable, a distinct advantage,'' stated Ottmar Jannusch,
siteleader at JJU, a leading independent hardware review site. ``In the
future, as processor speeds and the multitasking of applications increase, memory
performance will become even more important than it is today. RDRAM technology, unlike
SDRAM technologies, has the scalability and headroom to handle these increased traffic
loads.''
