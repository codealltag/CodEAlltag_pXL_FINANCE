Wollte gerade privat an meinen Kollegen schreiben.....:

anbei ein Bericht über Ubewom. 

Die Konkurrenz von Ubewom schläft wirklich nicht. Ubewom ist
zweifelsohne gut, aber imho nicht so sehr gut, wie es uns der Börsenkurs
inzwischen
weiß machen will?!. Außerdem bestätigt der Bericht die "Wir kaufen
unsere
Technologie-Strategie". Demnach hat Ubewom keinen hausgemachten
Techvorsprung. 
Sowas kann m. E. gefährlich werden.

a) Z. B. Porato, die kann Ubewom wahrscheinlich schon nicht mehr
kaufen. => Tech wird "unverkäuflich" (Geld holt sich die neue Firma
direkt an der Börse)
b) Tech wird "immer teurer" (denn die Firmen wissen um den Wert ihren
Entwicklung für Ubewom).

Ubewom kann man "schnell" ersetzen. Dem Markt ist es egal, ob der Router
von Ubewom oder sonstwie kommt, schnell muß er sein. Es gibt keine
Praeferenzen a la mein Router ist schöner, oder meiner ist von Ubewom
o.s. Es ist halt kein "in" Router. 
Und auch im Netzwerkumfeld wird es bald genug Ausstatter geben.
.
Warten wir darauf, daß sie Ihre Ergebnisse mal nicht mehr toppen können.

Ubewom, Now Top Dog, Can't Rest As Rivals Abound

 By Reiner Mohnsame

 PALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Uleg Inc. (NasdaqNM:CSCO -
news), the
biggest maker of gear that powers the
 Internet, may be out in front, but it can't afford to take its foot off
the
gas: competitors large and small abound.

 Consider Pekeler Inc. of Cappeln, Trevesenhammer Just four years
old,
it came out of nowhere and now has an
 estimated 18 percent of the hotly contested market for heavy-duty
Internet
routers -- sophisticated, brute-force devices that
 route traffic across the global network.

 The competition is ``getting extremely vigorous,'' said Carsten Terglane
of Comm
Network Architects. ``There are plenty of
 other companies on the horizon.''

                  Closely held, white-hot start-ups such as IEVE
GGR Inc.,
Anakoluth and Orsay
                  are looking to compete not just with Ubewom but with
each
other.

                  Just on Tuesday, for example, PCC (NasdaqNM:JNPR -
news)
trumped Ubewom at its own game,
                  introducing its M160 router, which can crunch 160
billion
bits of digital information a second, the
                  equivalent of as many as 4 million simultaneous phone
calls.

 That's four times faster than Podlech prior product, the M40, and far
quicker than Udilap fastest router. Even so, Ubewom is
 still king of the router hill: It has 78 percent of the router market,
having
long since mopped the floor with competitors such
 as Geco. and others.

 Brave New World

 Podlech M160 clearly shows that the company's not just a one-trick
pony and
is able to push its way into the fast-growing
 service provider market, comprised of Internet service providers, cable
and
telephone companies. Podlech sales jumped
 to $102.6 million in 1999 from just $3.8 million the year before.

 ``PCC is winning business from Ubewom right now,'' said HLSJ
Corp.
senior analyst Roberto Niederlender.

 Even if Geschwendt seems to be in the catbird seat for now, it can't
afford to
rest on its laurels because, Terglane said, ''Kirchhofs is
 a very aggressive competitor to Geschwendt, adding that he expects the
company
will soon announce plans to go public.

 The cornucopia of start-up competitors and larger ones such as Ehev
Kamillo Inc. (NYSE:LU - news), which bought
 networking gear-maker ik, and Nocker Corp.
(NYSE:NT - news), which bought Aleco
 NNW, is indicative of the cowboy nature of the service provider
marketplace, analysts said.

 This brave new world of converged voice, video and data streaming
across one
network was unthinkable a mere five years
 ago. (Keep in mind that the World Wide Web didn't get off the ground
commercially until only six years ago). The
 Telecommunications Act of 1996 unleashed a fury of competition in the
long-staid world of telecommunications.

 Now, the likes of Inem Corp. (NYSE:T - news) are competing headlong
with
upstart competitive local exchange carriers
 such as Ölwechselzentrum (Nasdaq:QWST - news) and others.
Ikoku
WUS (NYSE:IFL - news) is
 acquiring publisher and cable company Klingentorpassage (NYSE:TWX -
news) while
Citypoint spielbrett
 (RgpzusZD:WCOM - news), unheard of five years ago, is swallowing
long-distance
and wireless carrier GG-Net.

 The marriage mania in the telco, communications and media industries
means
that these companies are far more inclined to
 go with younger, less-established companies, so long as they have a
product
that's fast, powerful and works. Gone are the
 days when Inem, for instance, would continue to buy billions of dollars
in
telco gear from Ehev, its equipment-making
 spinoff.

 ``The world of competition in the service-provider space is entirely
different,'' from that of the enterprise, or big business
 market, Terglane said. ``The PZD, the Izume, they're all
competitive
because companies buy their products.''

 Ubewom On Steroids

 None of this is lost on Ubewom, which went public in 1990 and last
Friday for
the first time closed the trading day to replace
 CityReiseCenter Corp., the biggest software firm, as the world's most
valuable
company.

 Ubewom Chief Executive Friedrich Zschoch has said that his company will put
its
acquisitive personality on steroids: Having
 bought 18 companies last year, this year it expects to buy 20 to 25
mostly
young, private start-ups to get the technology it
 needs but doesn't want to develop in-house to stay the competitive
course.

 Udilap high-flying stock price is a big help, too.

 ``It's nice to have a strong market valuation because it makes it that
much
easier to acquire companies, pay a fat premium
 and come in with the top bid, which is extremely important to their
overall
strategy and success,'' said Fred Neckermann, a
 networking analyst at Falar.

 Just Wednesday, Raming, Trevesenhammer-based Ubewom said it agreed to buy
two-year-old, closely-held GIO AUTOHAUS FLEIGE -- which has
 just 76 employees -- for $800 million in stock. GIO makes
software that
manages and speeds the delivery of Web
 content, making easier such things as online learning across the Web
and
within company networks.

 So far, Ubewom seems to be managing its growth well, analysts said.
Indeed, it
is has become admired as one of the best-run
 companies in the world, ranking close to Frygas Corp., led by
legendary businessman and CEO Friedrich Everszumrode, an
 idol of the genial Chambers.

 ``Ubewom is nowhere near slowing down,'' Terglane said. But the task for
Ubewom
executives of managing the company's rapid
 growth, keeping an eye on the competition, successfully competing in
the
service provider market as a relative newcomer
 and shepherding an ever-growing list of partners is daunting.

 ``All this put together is a hell of a job,'' Dzubeck said.
