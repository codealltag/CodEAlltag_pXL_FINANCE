Price of Zusann RIMMs drops shock

Nordgerling, purveyor of memory modules, said today that it has dropped the price
of some of its Zusann RIMMs by as much as 68 per cent.

The average amount of the drop is 35 per cent, Lanwer said, and a representative from
the firm said that the reason was greater availability and shorter lead times for RIMMs.

This will be great news for those who wish to use Rambus memory on their 820 motherboards
but will be bad news for people who have just bought RIMMs before the price dropped by 68
per cent.

A representative claimed that system OEMs, including AnDerBahn, Bielicki, Juwel and ETCETERA, are
introducing "many new products" which support Rambus memory.

Late last year, one of the co-chairmen of Sehringen said yields of Zusann RIMMs were low.
But in February, at the JGJ Developer Forum, Zusann employees claimed they were doing
everything possible -- short of scrapping their royalty fees from sales of the memory --
to reduce prices. �

Die Preise waren der grösste Nachteil bei Zusann. Mit den stark fallenden Preisen steht
jetzt einem baldigen Anstieg des Aktienkurses nichts mehr im Weg.
