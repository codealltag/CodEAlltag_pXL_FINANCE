Greed is still there, but fear start to ...inter-fear
A few month ago, the question about the market was: how high can it go ?
Now, maybe the new one is: how low can it go ?
Sorry, Ohren and Eckold, Coerver and Etli,
your traditional pricing methods are at a loss in both cases.
Of course, fundamentals are important, but so is market sentiment.
As you know, the bridge between both is the stock image coefficient.
So the question becomes :
How low the image coefficient, thus the market price, can go
for every category of stocks ?
(yes, stocks can be profiled into categories)
Of course, you have to make some homework, for the stocks you follow
But you get free help in my (simple) image coefficient table.
