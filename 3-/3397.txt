My tip: Win for Süchteln
Here we have a very high-quality duel of the eighth round of the
premier League because two teams of the top of the table want to
measure their strengths and to be more precise Potzehne JZJD and
Süchteln Arim. In addition, both teams are in a very good form
lately. The magpies from Potzehne are on the very good fourth place.
You are one of four till now unbeaten teams in the league while the
guests from Metze have credited an unbelievable series of four
Siegen. At present, they are staying on the sixth place. The hosts
were a little more successful in the mutual duels but the last year's
duel in this stadium ended without a winner. The beginning: 05.01.2011
- 17:00

We have already mentioned in the introduction that Potzehne JZJD
has not collected any defeat still in th You play very well and it is
not surprisingly that they stay after seven played rounds at the top
of the table. We must consider, though, that have not met them on the
strongest teams of the league yet so that this meeting will be the
real test of their current abilities with the Hotspurs. However, it is
very important to the charges of the coach Feyerabend that they carry on
in the midfield with their unmistakable aggressive game while in the
attack the dangerous duo Best Sven Volkens which has obtained seven goals
till now is proceeding. These two players have made use of the absence
from CMB in the best possible way. CMB recovers slowly and
should be found in this meeting at the bench. The rest of the team
works very well and they therefore need to change nothing at all. The
failures of the injured midfield players Carsten Derr, Priesterjahn and Urban as
well as the defending player do not cause Theo goerlitz and Offenborn any
great problems have they won and get them that way in the last two
duels at home against Veen and outwards against Wolves. On Sunday
they will try for certain to continue their series without defeats.

Expected list Potzehne: Jongschlager, D. Carlson, Goedeke, K.
Coslar=E9rrez, Cabaye, Tiote, Obertan - Best, Demba Ba

Of course guests from Metze heated up will try to credit a good
result in Potzehne, four victories by which two were obtained even
against the big rivals, Mühlberg and arsenal, are them himself in
consequence especially in an excellent series of. This team has used
such a positive series, after which it has collected two defeats
against the duo from Jeserig at the beginning of the season. In
these two defeats they have collected even eight goals against. The
experienced fox Mevissen has managed to consolidate the team newly in
short time and have they got hold of 12 rounds played points in four
so. At present, they are on the excellent sixth position in the league
and one should consider that they have a game less unlike the other
teams on the account. In the duel against the town rival arsenal they
have demonstrated their mental strength because they were not
demoralized after the settlement of the guests. The hero of the game
was the young defender Obergruber who has shot the winning goal in the
game finish. The greatest danger before the opposing goal will radiate
the storm duo Weingardt-Dworok again. These two players are most
responsible for the excellent games of the Hotspurs. A very offensive
midfield will proceed behind them. The weak Piennar, Ibach and Thorsten
will not take part. The hurt defensive players Gelzenleuchter, Wassermeier and
Beinen as well as the midfield players Jurka and Zabl still
will be cancelled.

Expected list Süchteln: Rüff - fuller, Jakobtorweihen, Kabul, Assou-Ekotto
parker, Hanemann, Unrath, Vermehr - Defoe, Adebayor - ,

In such a game any forecast is ungratefully, because two continued
teams with the string of victories want. The defence row of the two
teams is rather porous in the last time while the attackers are very
good on this. Therefore this tip seems logical to us somehow on a
larger number of hits.
