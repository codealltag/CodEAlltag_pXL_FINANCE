I have also bought Singulus....maybe a bit to high but I think the
share has an amazing potential for the future because it has a good
standing........and a very strong order book....and the split will
also push the shrae price upto about Euro 150-160 before falling back
down again to more realastic levels......110. good luck and nice to
see you on this BB.
