The Martingale system is very easy to understand and follow. This is
why it
has become one of the most popular strategies used by players all over
the
globe. Watch out, it is a flawed system. But, I believe that with a
few
alterations the system can still be used to make consistent profits at
the
roulette table.
Rules
=EF=82=A7 Choose a colour (we=E2=80=9Fll use red for the example) and place=
 a $1 on
it.
Spin the wheel.
=EF=82=A7 If your bet loses then double your bet for the next spin (i.e. pl=
ace
$2
on red).
=EF=82=A7 If your bet loses again, then double up to $4
=EF=82=A7 If your bet loses, double up to $8
You probably understand by now. Keep doubling your stake if your bet
loses.
STOP as soon as you win. The amount won by doubling your stake
completely
offsets the loss of the previous bets.
Many of you will be thinking that this is great, and that you can=E2=80=9Ft
lose! Well,
this is true if two conditions are met. Firstly, you must have an
unlimited
bankroll. In theory any number of blacks may come out in a row =E2=80=93 by
doubling
your stake each time starting from just $1, 15 losing bets in a row
would
require you to place a $32,768 stake on the next bet. Second, and
related, the
system requires the casino to not have a table limit on the size of
the bet
accepted. All casinos have this limit =E2=80=93 and it is considerably smal=
ler
than
$32,768!
Is it still worth using?
In my eyes, the martingale system can be used effectively as a staking
plan in
the short run. However, I use the following alterations as I find it
more
profitable.
=EF=82=A7 Don=E2=80=9Ft stick to one colour. If you are waiting for red and=
 five
blacks
have come out in a row, then go for black! It has the same chance at
coming out as red.
=EF=82=A7 Play European roulette, with a single 0, and not American roulett=
e
with the single zero and double zero spaces. You should always play
European roulette for any system as the house edge is much lower.
=EF=82=A7 Play a short game. If you lose 5 in a row then stop betting and
start
again. It is not worth chasing with big stakes just to break even =E2=80=93=
 if
you hit the table limit then you are in trouble.
