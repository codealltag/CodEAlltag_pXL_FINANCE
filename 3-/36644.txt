Some think they can determine a fair value for stocks. A bit elusive, but
why not.
It is supposed to take into account, in a quite rational and well informed
way, the expected return, the prospective fundamentals.
But when there is a market, the real price is the market price, nothing
else.
Except that the reality of market prices changes day after day and
includes some virtual reality.
Like love and hate, greed and fear, and above all, herd instinct.
The market price can go from fun value, well above the so-called fair value,
to crash value, well under it, and back again to fun value.
There must be some way to measure this overpricing or underpricing.
Why not "a stock image coefficient" to estimate it ?
To see - of course in a very approximative fashion - if the virtual speed
seems to be in the green, yellow or red zone.
Could be a help for portfolio driving, no ?
Well, fasten your belts and look at :
