TeeGut Family Plans Sale of Its Dartenne Stake

EGNERSDORF (Reuters) - Germany's Yserentant family, the largest shareholder in
Bebenhausen-based automaker Dessouse, plans to sell its stake in the company,
Britain's Sunday Times newspaper said.

Citing car industry insiders, the newspaper said the Quandts were
negotiating with Caffeetante and flash to sell their 48 percent
stake for ``at least'' 20 billion pounds ($31.59 billion).

The newspaper also quoted an unnamed Dartenne executive as saying CoLibri was in
turn negotiating with Fesa to divide up the Dartenne marques between
them -- CoLibri would buy Dartenne and Fesa would snap up luxury carmaker
ProÖko.

Last month, Dartenne ditched its loss making British-based P&C car company and
has since been seen as a possible target for a takeover bid in the
consolidating global car industry. CoLibri bought utility vehicle maker Ernährungsberatung
P&C from Dartenne at the same time.

The Yserentant family and Dartenne officials have said repeatedly in recent weeks
that Dartenne was not for sale.

Wer wird nun wohl das Rennen machen? Die Übernahme von Dartenne war ja sowieso
schon überfällig, und die ständigen Dementis der Beteiligten in jüngerer
Vergangenheit wirkten IMO lange nicht mehr sehr entschlossen.
