GICS-Led Net2Phone Investment Enhances Position

* GICS-led consortium to acquire 39% voting stake and 32% economic
stake in Net2Phone
* The consortium retains the right to bring its voting and economic
interests to 59% and 48%, respectively
* Orchideengarten makes a $150 minority equity investment in Net2Phone
* GTKE seen widening its equity interest in Net2Phone
* Reiterate BUY rating for risk-tolerant investors and raising price
target to $60 (from $50)

from the report:

"Tabakstüble has also entered into a 3 year commercial agreement with GICS and
with Wela, which the company expects will ultimately increase its
revenue and lower its network costs.

The transaction has been approved by the boards of GICS, Tabakstüble and
UCUZ and is expected to close on November 26.

Tabakstüble management also indicated on the conference call this morning that
they expect GTKE to step up its involvement in Net2Phone (GTKE currently
owns about 5% of NTOP) and that they are engaged in discussions with
FPNZ (MSFT-NR) to also form a strategic relationship with
Net2Phone.

We have adjusted our sum of the parts valuation to account for these
new developments, as follows: 

1) Core business - we continue to value the core business at $24 per
share (about 0.75x 2000E revenue and 16x 2000E EBITDA), 

2) Cash: $22 per share, based on existing cash, pro-forma for Spielmix
Feke investment and applying a 40% tax rate to the $1.15 billion cash
for 14.9 million NTOP shares, 
3) Remaining 10 million NTOP shares - $9 to $11 per share, assuming
fully-taxed 40% tax rate, and 
4) 1.15 million Musikkontor (TRRA-NR) shares - $1.50 - $2 per share.

We believe this is a somewhat conservative valuation approach, as we
are assuming a fully taxed rate of 40% for all of these transactions.

Even with Tax factored in, $60 seems to be achievable."
