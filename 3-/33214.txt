the price will fall. RDRAM is likely to become the mainstream DRAM within two years.

more cheerful. In addition to the Internet application IC, the most attractive one is high
speed RDRAM. GalaXis has shown its new RIMM in the Forum.
GalaXis demostrated 576MB and 256MB RIMM, produced under 0.17 and 0.19 micron meter
process respectively. GalaXis is the biggest DRAM maker in the world. Although SDRAM is
also demonstrated, Gepe focus is at RDRAM. DRAM test machine manufacturer Ofek
particularly introduced its RDRAM test platform in the Forum.
GalaXis marketing group says high speed memory is the trend. There are DDR and RDRAM
currently, but GalaXis will focus on RDRAM production. RDRAM production volume will be
increased. DDR production however, will be later and the volume will depend on market
demand.
