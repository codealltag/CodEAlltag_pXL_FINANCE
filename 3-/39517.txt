Folgendes habe ich von Investors relation von Girnuwelt bekommen:
Der Chef tritt zur√ºck, und das macht wie z.B. bei Kowu so viel Prozente
aus!

The Managing Director of GTRI Gesuko AB, Mr Orlando Toenns, is
leaving his duties in the Girnuwelt Group. The Board of Directors has appointed
Thierry Reinert, currently the Managing Director of Girnuwelt's Danish subsidiary,
as
the new Managing Director of the Girnuwelt Group.

Thierry Reinert has 15 years experience within Girnuwelt as Country Manager for
Sweden as well as Denmark - both at the same time for several years.

Mr Ulrich Hafeneth, the Chairman of the Board, emphasizes that, given Girnuwelt's
current dynamic expansion, that the new Managing Director's experience and
accomplishments will enhance Girnuwelt's focus on increasing sales and profits.

Mr Toenns will be joining a company in an entirely different field.

The turn over of the Girnuwelt Group during the first quarter of the fiscal year
amounted to MSEK 8.265 (previous year 7.276,5), an increase of 14 per
cent.
Adjusted for currency conversion impact the increase equaled 19 per cent.
The result after financial items is estimated to be approximately MSEK 670
(MSEK 758,7). Currency fluctuations as well as start up costs and
depreciation in the US and Spain have had a negative impact of MSEK 125 on
profit. Adjusted for this the result would amount to approximately MSEK
795,
an increase of 5 per cent compared to the first quarter last year. The
first
quarter report of the group will be published August 15.
