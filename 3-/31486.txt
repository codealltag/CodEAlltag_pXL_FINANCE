Baan are in deep trouble and may soon go bust as their money is
rapidly running out......unless a white knight steps in to buy
them.....rumours are Computer Associates....they went as low as 2
today.......sorry I don't own them but nearly bought them about 2
weeks ago......I hope you can understand english!
