While I=E2=80=9Fm still continuously testing my flat betting system, that
should be available to you within the next two weeks, let me take you
back to the very classic Martingale double up system, that most of us
are convinced that using this method brings to disaster. That is true.
If you use Martingale, say over 9-11 bets continuously, it will
eventually deteriorate your bankroll, despite the fact that you have
been accumulating steady 1 unit profits over some time. If one limits
the Martingale to 3 to 5 steps in favourable situations, though, one
can still make profits without severely damaging his/her bankroll. A 3
step Martingale risks 7 units and a 5 step Martingale risks 31 units
(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16). Now, coming to the simple method. If you have a
pre-determined Red/Black betting sequence of 5 steps (say R, B, B, R,
R) what are the chances that you will be right on all 5 bets. The
answer is 50% (or =C2=BD) multiplied 5 times by itself, or 1 in 32. That
means that if you come to the Roulette table and tell yourself that
for the next 5 bets you will be betting R, B, B, R, R, regardless of
what comes up on the table, there is a 1 to 32 probability that you
will be hitting all bets right. Now, this is a very low probability,
isn=E2=80=9Ft it. I would never encourage you to do that. On the other hand=
,
the opposite is also true, that the probability of hitting all 5 bets
wrong is also 1 in 32. That means, that if you come to the Roulette
table and you bet a pre-determined sequence of say R, B, B, R, R, by
using a 5 step Martingale betting method, you have a 31/32 or 97%
chance that one of the 5 bets will hit right. Now, this sounds much
more encouraging, doesn=E2=80=9Ft it. One thing you should note, though, th=
at
it is not unlikely to get the exact opposite pattern: B, R, R, B, B,
even if it will happen 3% of the time. Particularly, if you bet your
pattern (R, B, B, R, R) continuously, statistically you should hit the
opposite pattern within the next 32 spins. And this would wipe out all
the profit units you accumulated so far. Our strategy will be then to
change the pattern after every winning sequence. This way you will be
attacking the next 5 bets, with an equal probability of 97% winning
chances from run to run. Mathematicians may argue with me, that
changing patterns doesn=E2=80=9Ft change the probabilities, but my own
experience have shown that every time I set a random betting sequence
of 5 bets and apply it, it hardly fails. And I retire after winning 10
units. I will now show you an actual run of my last visit to Casino de
Wattenweiler, on November 23. 07. 21, staying at the same table and playing every
single bet, using a 5 step Martingale, with $100 units.
The 5 step Martingale consisted of $100, $200, $400, $800, $1600 on
the high wager table, single zero wheel.
=EF=82=A7 Total risk per run $3100, my bankroll.
=EF=82=A7 Profit per run: $100.
=EF=82=A7 Profit expectancy: $1000 for 10 runs.
=EF=82=A7 Loss expectancy: $2200, if I was to lose one of the runs.
=EF=82=A7 Loss probability per run: 3%.
=EF=82=A7 Winning chances per run: 97%.
I have pre-determined my 10 sequences of 5 bets even before I went to
the casino. And they were: 1. R, R, B, R, B 2. B, B, R, B, R 3. B, B,
B, R, R 4. R, R, R, B, B 5. B, R, B, B, R 6. R, B, R, R, B 7. R, R, B,
R, B 8. B, B, R, R, R 9. R, R, B, B, B 10. B, B, R, B, B The outcome
of the table (30 continuous spins) was the following: Sequence number
Red/Black 1 B 2 B 3 B 4 0 5 R 6 R 7 B 8 R 9 B 10 B 11 B 12 B 13 R 14 R
15 B 16 R 17 B 18 R 19 B 20 R 21 R 22 B 23 B
24 R 25 B 26 R 27 B 28 B 29 B 30 R So, let=E2=80=9Fs see how the system
performed. I come to the Roulette table, and regardless of the
previous decisions, I look at my first betting sequence: R, R, B, R,
B, I bet $100 on Red. Run number 1: Looking at the table to sequence
1, I lose. I increase my bet to $200 and bet Red again, according to
my sequence. Black comes up in sequence 2 and I lose again. Now, I
raise my bet to $400 and bet on Black. This time Black comes up and I
win. My total profit, as you know is $100. Run number 2: I cross out
my first sequence and lay down my second sequence: B, B, R, B, R. If
you look at the table above, to sequences 4 to 8, that is to the next
5 bets, where I was left off in the previous run, you observe: 0, R,
R, B, R. Comparing this to my sequence: B, B, R, B, R, it catches a
winning bet at the fourth sequence, giving me another $100 profit. End
of run 2. I=E2=80=9Fm left off at sequence 7 on the table, my winning bet o=
n
Black. Run number 3: My third sequence is: B, B, B, R, R. Looking at
the table outcome starting from sequence 8, we see: R, B, B, B, B. I
catch a winning bet at the second bet at sequence 10. Run number 4: My
fourth sequence is: R, R, R, B, B, the exact negative of the previous
sequence, for no specific reason. The opposite of a random sequence is
still a random sequence and this is compared to the random outcome of
the table, with a 1 in 32 chance to have them all non-matching.
Looking at sequence 11, where we were left off, we see the outcome: B,
B, R, R, B. Comparing this to my fourth sequence, we see a match at
the third bet with Red at sequence 13. Run number 5: I start betting
my fifth sequence: R, R, R, B, B against the table=E2=80=9Fs outcome starti=
ng
at sequence 14, where we were left off: R, B, R, B, R. A match at the
first bet. This is my 5th $100 profit. I only played 14 spins and
already profited $500. I could have left at this point, but I wanted
to play all my 10 sequences. Run number 6: My sequence: R, R, R, B, B.
We are left off at sequence 15 on the table, that shows: B, R, B, R,
B. A winning bet at the second one with Red on sequence 16. Run number
7: My sequence: R, R, R, B, B against the table=E2=80=9Fs starting from
sequence 17: B, R, B, R, R. Second bet in sequence 18 wins. Run number
8: My sequence: B, B, R, R, R against the table=E2=80=9Fs, starting from
sequence 19: B, R, R, B, B. The first bet wins at sequence 19. Run
number 9: My sequence: R, R, R, B, B (another negative of the previous
one) against the table=E2=80=9Fs, starting from sequence 20: R, R, B, B, R.
First bet wins again.
Run number 10: My sequence is: B, B, R, B, B against the table=E2=80=9Fs,
starting from sequence 21: R, B, B, R, B. Second bet wins at sequence
22. Ten winning runs, a profit of $1000. That=E2=80=9Fs when I took the lea=

I=E2=80=9Fm not denying the possibility, that one of the patterns that I ch=
ose
to play, could lose all 5 bets, but again, the chances are 1 in 32 (or
3%) It=E2=80=9Fs important to chose a different pattern for every run, to h=
ave
an equal chance from run to run, as if you consistently use the same
pattern, you will eventually get the exact opposite one. Take a look
at my first sequence (R, R, B, R, B) for instance. If you look at the
table, the opposite of this pattern occurs at sequence 22 (B, B, R, B,
R). Now the chances that one of my 10 sequences will hit exactly this
spot is even lower than 3%. You may say that you have chosen a
pattern, i.e. B, B, B, B, B and getting 5 Reds is not unlikely. What
I=E2=80=9Fm claiming is that it would be a tremendous coincidence, with
likelihood of less than 3% of occurrance, that this sequence would
show up exactly when you chose yours. That is why it is crucial to
chose a different random pattern of 5 bets every time you start a new
run. If you consistently use the B, B, B, B, B, you are surely to hit
5 consecutive Reds sooner or later. This is a method that has worked
for me for quite a long time. Even if I get caught one day and lose 31
units, my profits will highly exceed the 31 units by then. You can
select a lower betting unit than $100 naturally. Try it first with $1
units, then escalate it to $10, $25 until you develop confidence.
Experiment with $1 units, to see at which stage you will lose all 5
bets of your sequence. It may take you quite a long time. Another
approach would be to start using $100 units. Once you made your first
5 units with $500 profit, you change tables to $10 minimum and have
fun with this method. If you lose your 31 units, you will be down by
$310. Since you were already up by $500, this loss will still keep you
ahead.
