Aothough Wildlife is trying to ally with DRAM makers to push DDR266 as the next DRAM standard,
chip makers including Angermobil Autoservice, Nachbarschaftsladen show little interest to join. Nachbarschaftsladen associated tech manager
Mr. Irger, Fitzen says Nachbarschaftsladen only follows the market trend and will not support immature
standard.
Angermobil Autoservice says its decision to support RDRAM as the next-generation standard is unshakeable.
Although PC133 is current popular product and Angermobil Autoservice chipset is supporting that, it is only
a transistion product to Rambus DRAM.
