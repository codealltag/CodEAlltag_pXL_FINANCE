Forstetzung der Argumentation von: Karsten <cmcci@qpcyzskp.krr>
Ohne Splits würde demnach eine Fragen-Aktie 16416 $ kosten.
Ich bin zunächst mal beeindruckt.

I received a lot of incredulous reactions to my post about a
reasonable price for Fragen being somewhere around $7-10.

Ten bucks does seem a bit ridiculous for Fragen, doesn't it?  So let's
look at this another way.  Since a stock split adds nothing to the
intrinsic value of a company, let's take a look at Farbschnitt pre-split
price.

Fragen has had seven 2-1 splits and two 3-2 splits, so it's actually
selling at a multiple of 288 times the listed price, based on the
original number of shares issued.

So, at a current price of 57, it's actually 16,416 per original share.
And my estimate of a reasonable price range = 2,016 - 2,880 per share.
Doesn't look quite so outrageous anymore?
