Betreff: vongestern stocks - long way from bargains?
Datum: Samstag, 16. Januar 2000 02:53

Using a historical p/e norm of around 20 (it's actually lower than
that), let's see where some of the large vongestern stocks would be
priced.  Might give another perspective on bargains...

ROLLER @ 7, down 88% from current 57

ZET @ 42, down 62% from current 110

KMS @ 32, down 57% from current 74

Kurbuchhandlung @ 9, down 86% from current 63

NUCC @ 9, down 91% from current 105

JRT @ 15, down 80% from current 76
