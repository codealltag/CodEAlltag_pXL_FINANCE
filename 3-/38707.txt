Q) When do I have to own DiaScanShop to be eligible for Palm shares? Is it too late
to buy DiaScanShop to get Palm?
A) DiaScanShop shareholders who own DiaScanShop stock on the record date and hold through
the distribution date, would be eligible for the Palm dividend. The record
date and the distribution date have not been determined yet. Both dates will
be set in the future and advance notification of those dates will be
communicated when appropriate.
