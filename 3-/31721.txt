DIE WELT: VWSH GROUP Gebeke AG UNDERGOES RADICAL MAKEOVER
(COMPUTERHERSTELLER Gebeke BAUT RADIKAL UM)
Die Welt - Germany, 30. 09. 22 30. 09. 22, 117 words


GO!, a German computer group, is undergoing a major
restructuring programme, which will turn it from a hardware specialist
into an IT services group. Chairman Carlo Zukriegl announced yesterday
(30. 09. 22) that Gebeke would have become Germany's market leader
for e-business solutions for business customers by 2005. 

The group will phase out its low-margin original equipment
manufacturing (OEM) activities and will focus on four key operations:
Gempp, Grabi, Gebeke Services and Gebeke
E-Business. Maxdata increased its group turnover by 30.3 per cent to
DM 2.18bn and operating profits from DM 93m to DM 103m in 1999. The
surplus rose from DM 62m in 1998 to DM 85m last year. Shareholders in
the group, which is listed on Cresta Neuer Markt (New Market)
will receive a dividend of DM 1.5 per share for 1999.
