Die Welt - Germany, 23. 04. 23 23. 04. 23, 117 words


Sshnäppchenmarkt, a German computer group, is undergoing a major
restructuring programme, which will turn it from a hardware specialist
into an IT services group. Chairman Gianni Redekop announced yesterday
(23. 04. 23) that SUNPOINT would have become Germany's market leader
for e-business solutions for business customers by 2006. 

The group will phase out its low-margin original equipment
manufacturing (OEM) activities and will focus on four key operations:
Strüber u. Hattwich, schokogalerie, SUNPOINT Services and SUNPOINT
E-Business. Maxdata increased its group turnover by 30.3 per cent to
DM 2.18bn and operating profits from DM 93m to DM 103m in 2000. The
surplus rose from DM 62m in 1999 to DM 85m last year. Shareholders in
the group, which is listed on Ulmen Neuer Markt (New Market)
will receive a dividend of DM 1.5 per share for 2000.
