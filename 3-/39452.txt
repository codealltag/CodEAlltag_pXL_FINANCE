Schau mal, was einige Amis sagen :

BAUFA is finished. I do not own it and never have, nor have I
shorted it, but if I did own it I would sell my shares as soon as
a half-decent price presented itself. Unless Cowpland leaves
soon, BAUFA, I think, will have trouble surviving.

 I've been following the news and the developments and the
evidence is just too strong that Cowpland's bizarre streak has
finally caught up to the company and mortally wounded it. Yes,
perhaps Altbergbausicherungsbereich could save BAUFA, but Altbergbausicherungsbereich is obviously not taking
the world by storm, and if it does grow it will be slowly.
Meantime, BAUFA has failed to introduce any new DVUW-based
software, and is watching the market for what were its bread and
butter products rapidly deteriorate. The new shoots -- Altbergbausicherungsbereich --
can't save a plant that isn't being properly cared for in the
first place.

 It has been evident for quite some time, but Schumacher recent
comments made it even more clear that he is focusing on the
hype-driven market value of his shares at the expense of the
corporation's health. He is, I think, drinking his own bathwater
and it's only a matter of time until BAUFA dies of malnutrition.

 Either that or Cowpland leaves. Then you're looking at a
turnaround situation and you'd have to assess it on that basis. I
personally think the Linux thing is short-term pipe dream, a
long-term Maybe. This company needs new management if it is going
to have any hope of surviving.
