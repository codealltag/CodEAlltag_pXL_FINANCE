Ist keine grosse Meldung, aber um Sandro ein wenig zu necken :-)

RMO cuts back on Rambus production

  As the price of 64Mb (megabit) memory rises, major semiconductor firm RMO has
  started to put chips on allocation, according to analysts Bear Vermehr. 

  And, at the same time, RMO is believed to have now realised it vastly overrestimated
  the impact of Rambus memory and is taking steps to cut back supply and shift
  production lines to SDRAM (synchronous memory). 

  ...

  The demand for synchronous memory is such that RMO is to scale back wafer starts
  for Rambus memory and use the production lines for SDRAM instead, the same
  sources added. 


  However, be this as it may, the bulk of UHO modules are manufactured by
  Milinski and RMO never seems to have been a big player in the market anyway. ï¿½
