*Market sentiment?
How come it changed direction, from bull to bear?
Well, in the first place,how come it took the previous direction?
- Dear Herwig, I always found bulls and bears suspicious animals, even if I
am one of them.

*Market manipulators?
How come so many gurus, media, funds, brokers said one thing and did
another? Just a lack of attention, I suppose.
-Dear Erbersdobler, I'm always suspicious of advices given to me for my best
interest.

A hard case! Maybe you find some hints in my personal site.
