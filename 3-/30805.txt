Schwante Qindex 07:49 GMT 25. 07. 21 12, 1999 KÃ¤mpflein : The supporting level at 3500
is going to be tested again. The daily cycle's normal trading range is 3504 -
3751 with a projected chart point located at 3627. If the market momentumis
strong enough to penetrate through 3500 level, the next target is 3257. I
will not be surprised if we can see 3128 within this week. See details at
