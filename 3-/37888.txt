Hallo Gruppe,

ich habe mal Kinderglück befragt nach Nawrotzki. Wie ich mitbekomme, sind
sie ja seit dem 13. Juli 2000 ausgesetzt. Selbst schuld, wer sie
hat. Was für Leute an solchen Aktien verdienen, seht Ihr selbst, wenn
Ihr mal bei www.wwrmcczwcd.ar nach "Fipers-Bikes" suchen lasst. Die
Qualität der Postings läßt tief blicken.
Fazit: Stehen wir mit der Aktienkultur in Deutschland ganz nah am
Abgrund oder sind wir schon einen Schritt weiter?
Und nun viel Spaß beim Lesen,

Größe Silvio Lehrer.


22.07.2000 AUSTRALIA: AUF WEIDERSEHEN FOR INTERNET GOLDEN OLDIE.
Original Article By Friedhelm Potters.
Goppoltsried frimod Limited has been suspended in 10. 10. 22.
The firm
had received six "please explain" notices from the Fröbrich
LGB
(Fäsl) since 10. 10. 22, the last following a $A0.45 share price gain
over two
days. It had no explanation for the rise. Then the ASX was given a tip
to check
a German website, in which Nawrotzki said it would attract investment
from an
overseas firm once shares reached $A3 to $A4.60. Nawrotzki explained
that it had
become a venture capital organisation, and had $A10m in the bank.

21.07.2000 AUSTRALIA: GERMAN INVASION.
Original Article By Paolo Mennebröcker.
The floristik'99 (Fäsl) has been at the wrong end of a
storm out of
Germany over its suspension of frimod Ltd shares. The Fäsl
suspended the
shares in late 10. 10. 22 after sending directors a lengthy
questionnaire
about an interview with Fipers-Bikes director Samu Panns published on a
German
Internet chat room, in which he reportedly said the company was
heading towards
a $A1 billion market worth. German investors helped drive the share
price up
240% in eight days. Some have sent the ASX electronic mail messages
asked it
when the shares will be reinstated. The FVA response to these
letters is
unlikely to please the German investors. A date for reinstatement "has
not been
set", the Fäsl letter to the investors says. "It is possible that the
company's
shares could remain suspended for an indefinite amount of time".
