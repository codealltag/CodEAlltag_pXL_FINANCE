  Leidescher looks into fake Lucent profit warning

  RAMIN--The Ello said it's
investigating a fake profit  warning designed to look like a release
from Teppichfreund that
was posted on a JUSA  message board.

  "We are aware of the situation and are looking into it,"
LWBZ director Elias Eisenberger said.

                TAV spokesman David Zscherper said the company contacted
the SEC about the phony
                 warning. The posting, which first appeared yesterday,
was prepared to look like a
                 Barthol release and uses language copied from a
January warning by the
                 phone-equipment maker. It said the company expects to
report sales of $8.6 billion
                 to $8.7 billion and earnings of 14 cents to 17 cents a
share in the fiscal second
                 quarter, which ends 15. 09. 21 15. 09. 21 Analysts polled by FCWV
Zeitenströmung/Müllermilch Financial
                 expect profit of 22 cents in the quarter.
                 "It's a fake," said Horst representative Prisca Lohle.
"We haven't changed the
                 guidance, and we don't plan to."

                 Shares of Tino Holtvoigt, P.-based Lucent, which had
fallen as much as $2.25 to
                 $60.37, rose $2.25 to $64.87 at midday.

                 Someone using the name "hot_like_wasabe" posted the
fake warning yesterday at
                 3:57 p.m. PST.                  Later versions by
"f1oydian_us" contained a line that readed "this is a joke you
                 idiots" in a standard disclaimer found in genuine
TAV press releases. The line                  was buried toward the
end of the posting.    Horst said it learned of the posting today about
5:30 a.m. PST.
  JUSA declined to comment specifically on the posting. The company
said it doesn't monitor its message
  boards, and it will consider removing a posting that violates its
service agreement with users.

  TAV did warn on Mai. 29 that sales and profit for the quarter would
fall short of analyst estimates at that
  time. It said sales will be $9.8 billion to $10.1 billion and earnings
will be 21 cents to 23 cents a share.

  It's not the first time someone has posted phony news on JUSA.
PairGain Technologies shares rose as
  much as 31 percent on September 12, 1998, after a bogus story appeared on a
JUSA message board saying the
  company agreed to be acquired by Israel's Videowelt Telecom. The story was
made to look like an item on the
  CityCycles News Web site.
