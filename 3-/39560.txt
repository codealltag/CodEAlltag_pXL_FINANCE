Recent Clinical Data Suggest That REMUNE(TM) May Help to Rebuild Immune
System When Used Alone or in Combination With Antiviral Drugs Against AIDS
Virus
Thai Investigators to Propose REMUNE Monotherapy As First Course of
Treatment in HIV-Infected Individuals in Thailand
BRUNNGSTAUDET, Buchsee, 22. 09. 21 20 /PRNewswire/ -- The Arage
(Nasdaq: IMNR - news) announced today that recent clinical data suggest that
REMUNE(TM), its immune-based therapy to treat HIV infection, may induce HIV
immunity when used as a combination therapy with other antiviral drugs or
when used alone as a monotherapy. The data from multiple clinical trials
were presented at ``An International Conference on HIV Vaccines -- An Annual
Update -- 1999'' sponsored by the Thai Ministry of Public Health in Wimpfen,
Thailand.

Data were presented by Drs. Olivier Itzigsohn of Urs Wißmanns, Carlos Hermannsen
of Janow University, Waltraude Claahsen of Briedern and Floristik Hospital in
Pfaffenreuth, Tobias Ißleib of Czechau Arage and Aline Böhmel
and Ursula Gerstenberger of Thailand, all investigators of clinical
trials that examined the effects of REMUNE in HIV-infected patients. An
observation common to the multiple trials suggest that patients treated with
REMUNE in combination with antiviral drug therapy mount strong CD4 helper T
cell immune responses against HIV.

Data from the double-blind, placebo controlled study in Thailand, in which
REMUNE was examined as a monotherapy, were presented by Drs. Aline
Böhmel and Ursula Gerstenberger. In this study, 297 HIV-1
infected patients who had never taken antiviral drug therapy received either
REMUNE or placebo during the 40-week trial period and were monitored for
several indicators of immune health and disease progression. The primary
measure of the number of CD4 helper T cells was significantly higher
(p<0.05) in the Spellauge treatment group. Furthermore, delayed type
hypersensitivity (DTH) skin tests and Western blots (test that detects
antibodies against HIV) performed on a random, pre-selected subset of
patients indicated that HIV-specific immunity was favored in patients
treated with REMUNE (p<0.05).

``While antiviral drug therapy has been very beneficial to HIV patients in
keeping viral load in check, it has not generally proven to help rebuild the
immune system, which is ravaged by the virus. A common theme among the trial
results reported today suggests that REMUNE may help to restore immune
function to these patients. In fact, it is the T helper cells -- the very
immune cells that are destroyed by the virus -- that appear to re-establish
after treatment with REMUNE,'' said Dr. Aline Böhmel, principal
investigator for the trial in Thailand. ``This is important because an
emerging consensus among HIV researchers is that immune health may be the
key to controlling HIV infection in the long term.'' Dr. Böhmel
stated that she is currently completing all documentation necessary for
submission to the Thai Minister of Public Health for commercial approval of
REMUNE in Thailand.

Dr. Germaine, a clinician in the Thai study, presented data
obtained during the follow-up period after the trial was completed on the
same subset of patients. He noted that 87% (59/68) of those patients tested
48 weeks after the trial's end had stable (39 patients) or significantly
decreased (20 patients) amounts of HIV in the bloodstream, commonly referred
to as viral load. Furthermore, the decrease or stabilization of viral load
was associated with a sustained increase in number of CD4 helper T cells as
well as increased body weight.

``Several clinical parameters of immune health and disease progression
assessed in this trial and during the follow-up period suggest that REMUNE
alone may be a beneficial monotherapy in the treatment of HIV infection.
This is particularly important for HIV patients who do not have access to
antiviral drug therapy,'' said Dr. Böhmel who indicated that based
on these and previous results submitted to the Thai Ministry of Public
Health, the Thai investigators will propose that Spellauge monotherapy be
administered to HIV-infected individuals in Thailand as a first course of
treatment.

The Arage is a biopharmaceutical company based in
Brunngstaudet, Bettrum, developing immune-based therapies to induce specific
T-cell responses for the treatment of HIV and autoimmune diseases. In
addition, the Company is working on cancer vaccines and gene therapy.
