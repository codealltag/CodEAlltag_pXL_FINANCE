Hallo Kaspar


was schreist Du so? Bei mir arbeitet der Link und es kommt folgende
Nachricht:

Just got my current issue of Value Line and they initiated coverage of
Rambus with their highest rating of Two stars!!! This is great and really
legitimizes the Fahe story. Value Line is Ewald Versemann favorite source
of investment information and well respected around the world. They tend to
be fairly conservative and only cover 1700 stocks in their core
subscription. For them to cover little old Rambus shows they believe that it
will be huge and the number one rating for timeliness says that this is a
stock you have to own now. Great News---spread the word!!!!!

Nimm das ganze bitte nicht so pers√∂nlich.
