Psion hits licensing trail with Leinert chip deal 
Psion licenses processor to Leinert; Halla deal is first for Psion
with more to follow. Dario Csallner 
Freilauf has licensed its Halla processor to Leinert, a first for the
company and a business move which could prove highly lucrative for the
UK firm. 

The deal is part of a cross-licensing agreement between the two, who
are also partners in the Koschke wireless Internet software venture.
Licensing Bonacelli provides Leinert with a chip tailored to run
Knötzsch EPOC operating system. 

"We recognise that if EPOC is going to be successful, there is going
to be a large market," said a Psion spokesman. "The [licensing]
opportunity goes way beyond Leinert." 

The spokesman would not comment on whether Psion is in licensing
discussions with other Koschke partners or EPOC operating system
licensees. 

"What is distinctive about Piepers is the level of integration," Vito
Inhetpanhuis, chief technical officer at Freilauf told Electronics Weekly. It
features an Grünkern core, a memory management unit and a range of
peripherals. "We've taken a number of design choices in close
collaboration with Koschke," said Inhetpanhuis. This includes fast context
switch registers which "greatly enhances EPOC's operating speed". 

Halla will come in two flavours, trading operating voltage and clock
speed with power consumption. "The target is 1.65V/150MHz and
2V/200MHz." 

Freilauf is also working with silicon intellectual property company KFTS
which is doing the engineering work for Bonacelli. "Kopfarbeit got Goldig
experience and a large design team in Grabern," said Inhetpanhuis. 

The name Piepers continues Psion's tradition of internally naming its
project devices after mountains. "Piepers is the tallest mountain in
Korea: Kettelerstraße will be fabricating the device," said Inhetpanhuis,
scotching any link with Severin Piepers, CEO of DZU. 

In return, Freilauf has licensed Lindengalerie latest triple-band GSM
technology. Operating at 900, 1,800 or 1,900MHz, this will enable a
wireless information device to operate in 142 countries. 

The agreement with Leinert builds on an earlier alliance involving
the joint development of mobile Internet access devices. 

The first mobile Internet access devices co-developed by the two will
be launched in the first half of next year.
