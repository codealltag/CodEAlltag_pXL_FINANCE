The results speak for themselves: After executing the OfficeBench 1.2 Multitasking script
against our demanding "constant computing" loading scenario, the 800MHz i820 system came
out the clear winner with a completion time of 96 seconds - 17% faster than the 800MHz
i440BX system, which completed the same script in just over 115 seconds. When we repeated
the tests at 600MHz, the gap narrowed to 10%, demonstrating that in fact i820 performs
better at higher frequencies.

10% schneller bei 600 Mhz
17% schneller bei 800 Mhz

Wieviel schneller bei 1,4 Ghz im 3. Quartal?  Laut B ca. 30% und mehr.
