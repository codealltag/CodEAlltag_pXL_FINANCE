Who said investors were self-centered?
Do you see how much capital they throw at yir.qan companies?
While knowing that many of those probably will never make enough profits to
give a fair return on capital
Thanks to all who keep investing with such selfless dedication, for the good
of the new economy
and its benefit to mankind (better productivity, more services, more
employment, lower prices, wow!)
Thanks also to those, may be a little more self-centered, who prefer to find
in my site the difference between firms' fundamentals and stocks' images.
