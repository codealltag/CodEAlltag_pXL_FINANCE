Surely by now every newsgroup on the planet knows this is a scam.

The average monthly pay in Russia is $US64.   In Schwinkendorf $200.  So these guys
think this is manna from heaven.  So long as one newbie from somewhere on
the planet thinks he can get something for nothing every month these
pirates, hacks and copyright thieves are laughing

Plenty email to me to say either many programs didn't load, others didn't
work and some are still waiting by the letter box hoping something will turn
up.
You don't need to buy this crap.
