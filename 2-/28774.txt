There are more and more information and discussions about behavioral finance
(for example the controversy about Kort book "Irrational exuberance")
Some think BF is the finance theory's new frontier, others that it is a
small sectarian branch.
To add to the controversy, remind my own definition of market efficiency
*Prices result from information ...except when they result from beliefs and
emotions*
Well, future will tell if BF is or not the new paradigm. But better keep
updated.
