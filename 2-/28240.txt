I would like to exchange opinions about
the commercially available tradesystems
and get in touch with people who have the
same interest.

People often say that all commercial
systems are junk. Even if that is the
case and the only solution for a trader
is to create his own, it's still useful
to have some idea of the performance
characteristics (including but not
limited to Tradestation's Performance
Summary screen) of the commercial systems
as a yardstick against which to measure
our own work.

Is FuturesTruth reports the only choice
for commercial systems evaluation ?

Any suggestions about people with solid
ideas ? How about Mühlenfeld, Stegmeir, Hackenschmied,
Günter Nücklaus, Victor Steuding, Borggräfe,
Fiegweil, Isaacsohn, Vizethum, Wzycotpd,
Coppers, Zellmann, Karner, Blass,
Etspüler, Herse, Jungers etc to
name a few ?

Please feel free to contact me by email.


Regards, Theodor.
