WARNING: Nils may also be related to a child porno ring. Lately, he
has been using the same IP addresses to post his messages that are also
being used to post child pornography information.

Nils is one of the crooks who has been spamming these newsgroups for
the last year. These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and they
have been found to contain Trojan Horse code. Recently, a copy of
CMKF 2001 was found with code written into is that is similar to
the Walmart virus. You will see that activity with your firewall, but virus
scanners are not catching it.

It is known that these thieves are collecting user information when you
reply to their email or visit their sites. Once they get the information,
they then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail
relay or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server. The
unlucky person this time is IP: 357.342.17.657.


If you receive unsolicited email from any of these scammers, report it as
spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
