WARNING: "hgdbv@0i.uec" is part of the same organized scam to rip you
off! Both devil_softw and trade4_yy (and other "trade__" names) are the
same person. His constantly changing addresses and names should be a
clear indication of his dishonesty. These programs were cracked in
Eastern Europe and there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan
Horses programmed to distribute your protected account information at
predetermined times.

It has recently been found that this person is collecting user
information when you reply to his email. Once he gets the information, he
then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail relay
or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server. Webmasters have
seen a pattern of attacks correspond to people answering email or
contacting these crooks.

If you receive unsolicited email from any of these scammers, report it as
spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
