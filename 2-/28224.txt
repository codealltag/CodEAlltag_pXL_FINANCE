WARNING: This thief goes by the name of both dwane and pcnerd. He also
uses many other different names so he can claim that he is not the person
who either ripped you off or sold you software that does not operate as
it was originally designed. If you haven't been paying attention to the
news, the Eastern European criminal empire is thriving. This person is
part of that criminal element. These programs were cracked in Russia and
there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to
distribute your protected account information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. They then use either your system or that of your ISP to post
their messages. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these
crooks, report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
