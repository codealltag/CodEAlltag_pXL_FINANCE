Und was für tolles...

  Meanwhile, Steigerlager proposition to replace defective Cape Cod mobos with VC820s
  and 128MB of Rambus RIMM seems to be somewhat problematical too. One
  customer was told by SeeReiseBüro earlier this week that the probability is that the RIMMs will
  be PC700 non-ECC parts. 

  However, the VC820 has two RIMM slots, and the other slot will have to be replaced
  with a continuity RIMM, which SeeReiseBüro is not supplying with the replacements. This will cost
  money, the continuity parts are hard to find. He has tried four major distributors without
  success and does not know how much extra he will have to pay. 

  And Helena has started to gently massage the English language by telling its
  customers that the recall is not a recall at all, but an "optional replacement". Some
  option, huh? �
