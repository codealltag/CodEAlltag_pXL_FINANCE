WARNING: This person is part of an organized scam to rip you off! Both
devil_softw and "trade4_yy (and other "trade__" names) are the same
person. His constantly changing addresses and names should be a clear
indication of his dishonesty. These programs were cracked in Eastern
Europe and there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses
programmed to distribute your protected account information at
predetermined times.

It has recently been found that this person is collecting user
information when you reply to his email. Once he gets the information, he
then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail relay
or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server. Webmasters have
seen a pattern of attacks correspond to people answering email or
contacting these crooks. If you receive unsolicited email from any of
these scammers, report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
