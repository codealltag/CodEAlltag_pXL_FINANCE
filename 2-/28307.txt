WARNING:

This man is unknown. He had never bought any program from me.
I can suppose that he is software developer or other interested party.

What scam do you mean ??? All customers receive their programs.
Don't talk nonsense !!! Do you have real proves ?!
Programs are FULLY FUNCTIONAL ! They don't contain Trojan horses and
viruses. We don't need to sell programs in order to get your protected
information. If we wanted to do it we would distribute programs for
free.
It's just SOFTWARE BUSINESS...

Order programs by e-mail: hzuxl@kpwv.juo

Regards to all my customers.
