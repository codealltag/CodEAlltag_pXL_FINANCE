WARNING: This person is part of an organized scam to rip you off! Both
devil_softw and newsoft_2k are the same person. His constantly changing
addresses and names should be a clear indication of his dishonesty. These
programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high likelihood
that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your protected
account information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that this person is collecting user
information when you reply to his email. Once he gets the information, he
then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail relay
or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server. Webmasters have
seen a pattern of attacks coming from mhj.lfw.car, which is in Russia.
These attacks correspond to people answering email or contacting this
crook in particular. If you receive unsolicited email from any of these
scammers, report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
