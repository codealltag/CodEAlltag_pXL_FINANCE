WARNING: This person is part of an organized scam to rip you off! These
people are skilled at convincing you to trust them. Their constantly
changing names and addresses are proof enough of their integrity. A few
days ago this person was going by softy_y3, now he is newsoft_2000.

These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high
likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your
protected account information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these crooks,
report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
