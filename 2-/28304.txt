WARNING: This is an organized scam to rip you off! These people are
skilled at convincing you to trust them. If you haven't been paying
attention to the news, the Eastern European criminal empire is thriving.
These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high
likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your
protected account information at predetermined times.

Currently, both Bulgarian and Czech Republic companies are protecting
these criminals from international law. Also, it has recently been found
that several members of this gang are collecting user information when
you visit their websites or send them email.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
