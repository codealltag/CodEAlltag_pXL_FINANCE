WARNING: "newsoftware_y2k" is part of an organized scam to rip you off!
These people are skilled at convincing you to trust them. Their
constantly changing names and addresses are proof enough of their
dishonesty. A few days ago this person was going by newsoft2000year, now
he is newsoftware_y2k.

These crash prone programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a
high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute
your protected account information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these crooks,
report it as spam to the proper authorities. The unlucky victim this time
has the IP address of 510.97.442.7.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
