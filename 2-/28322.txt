WARNING: devilprgs and trade_4uuu is the same person! This person is
irrational and is part of an organized scam to rip you off! His
constantly changing addresses and names should be a clear indication of
his dishonesty. If you haven't been paying attention to the news, the
Eastern European criminal empire is thriving. These programs were cracked
in Eastern Europe and there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan
Horses programmed to distribute your protected account information at
predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these crooks,
report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
