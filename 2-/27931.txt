I got this tip today from

and thouhgt it might be of interest to others. I'm getting the FREE
trial and have received some great trading tips already plus what
looks like some great picks. They offer picks in several price ranges
including pennystocks, stocks between $2-$10, and the higher priced
issues. I can't wait to get the special report titled MAGIC 11 on how
to make up to $60,000 a year playing these cheaper stocks. Anyway,
enjoy. L

"What is the most important Moving Average line? My program gives me 
the option of using 9 day, 15 day, 20 day, 50 day 100 day, and 200
day?"

All of them are important but here is a general guide. For very short 
term moves watch the 9 and 15 day MA. If the stock is using them as
support it
should be moving or stair stepping up very quickly. For a longer term
hint of
the overall direction of the stock use the 50-day MA and watch to make
sure it stays
above it. So if your stock is staying above its 15 DMA and then
tomorrow falls
through it, it probably will fall for a few points before it stops the
slide.
Short time span MA's are great at keeping you in the game for fast
movers. You might want to go to this site and enter the numbers you
