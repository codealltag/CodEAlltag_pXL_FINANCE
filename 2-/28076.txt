WARNING: This person, "trade4__you," is a partner of Kahep. Both
devil_software and trade4__you (and other "trade__" names) is the same
person. These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and probably
contain Trojan Horses code similar to that found in the OmniTrader 1999
they are selling. You will see that activity with your firewall, but
virus scanners are not catching it.

It has recently been found that this person is collecting user
information when you reply to his email. Once he gets the information, he
then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail relay
or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server.

If you receive unsolicited email from any of these scammers, report it as
spam to the proper authorities. recyytow_yup is not here to help you, in
the past he has admitted he is a thief.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
