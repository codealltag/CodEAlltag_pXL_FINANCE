BEWARE: This person uses many other different names so he can claim that
he is not the person who either ripped you off or sold you software that
does not operate as it was originally designed. He generally goes by
pcnerd or dwane.

He is also the person who has been selling the recent copies of
Duisback 2000 that was found with code written into is that is similar
to the TintenKontor virus. You will see that activity with your firewall, but
virus scanners are not catching it. Since that was discovered, he has
been on a massive spamming campaign.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. pcnerd/dwane is especially bad when it comes to spamming
email. Many people are reporting that he uses high pressure tactics to
try to separate you from your money. If you receive unsolicited email
from one of these crooks, report it as spam to the proper authorities.

WARNING!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
