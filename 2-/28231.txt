WARNING: The thief, "tradefor_you" is a person who has exhibited serious
irrational behavior in the past, and is doing it one again! Both
devil_software and tradefor_you (and other "trade__" names) is the same
person. These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high
likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your
protected account information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that this person is collecting user
information when you reply to his email. Once he gets the information, he
then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail relay
or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server. The latest
victim of his illegal activities has the ip address of 427.384.289.2.

If you receive unsolicited email from any of these scammers, report it as
spam to the proper authorities. dbtbabkh_mtz is not here to help you, in
the past he has admitted he is a thief.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
