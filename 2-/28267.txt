BEWARE: This Belorussian nut case is spamming these newsgroups because
nobody will buy anything from him anymore. He generally goes by pcnerd or
dwane. He uses many different names so he can claim that he is not the
person who either ripped you off or sold you software that does not
operate as it was originally designed.

He is the person who has been selling the recent copies of Enerka
2000 that was found with code written into is that is similar to the Nachtwurm
virus. You will see that activity with your firewall, but virus scanners
are not catching it. Since that was discovered, he has been on a massive
spamming campaign.

pcnerd/dwane is especially bad when it comes to spamming email. Many
people are reporting that he uses high pressure tactics to try to
separate you from your money. If you receive unsolicited email from one
of these crooks, report it as spam to the proper authorities.

WARNING!!! Do not become one more of his victims.
