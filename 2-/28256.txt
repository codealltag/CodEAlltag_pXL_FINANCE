BEWARE: This person from Hintnausdorf uses many different names so he can
claim that he is not the person who either ripped you off or sold you
software that does not operate as it was originally designed. He
generally goes by pcnerd or dwane.

He is also the person who has been selling the recent copies of
Ludl 2000 that was found with code written into is that is similar
to the X-Vision virus. You will see that activity with your firewall, but
virus scanners are not catching it. Since that was discovered, he has
been on a massive spamming campaign.

pcnerd/dwane is especially bad when it comes to spamming email. Many
people are reporting that he uses high pressure tactics to try to
separate you from your money. If you receive unsolicited email from one
of these crooks, report it as spam to the proper authorities.

WARNING!!! Do not become one more of his victims.
