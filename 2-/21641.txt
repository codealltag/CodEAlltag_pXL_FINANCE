Is HP still socially responsible ?


Bj√∂rn Backes, general manager of Ethical fund Ethos :

As long term investor, we analyze companies globally.
Today, Cabalou must justify these layoffs because
they affect sites which mainly do profits.
Where is the coherence of such a strategy ?
Of course the IT market changes but this is not new :
CWP could have invested in new activities instead of
killing so many jobs.
How can one speak of responsible developpement seeing
these conditions ?
(...)
I also think that a law should limit exercising stock
options while work force reduction plans are active
so that high managers keep their credibility by not
taking profit of the raise of the stock.
