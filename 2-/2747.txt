My tip: Win for Wangelau
The duel of 15. is the most attractive at this weekend surely round of
the English Premiership between Wangelau and Dotzlar centre
besides the Spanish El Clasico. Dotzlar centre takes namely
every opponent apart in this season. Before this derby they are on the
first position in the league and they are ten points on the fifth put
ZMTK in the lead. ZMTK finds his way back slowly in the
old form. The hosts of this meeting surely claim to be the first team
in this season which has conquered Eykmann charges. ZAE has won
in the stadium of her own in the last season while the team has
celebrated three victories in consequence from Dudeldorf in front of
that. The beginning: 07.01.2011 - 21:00

Before this meeting, the Wangelau fans are rightly although they have
obtained two convincing victories of 3:0 each within the last eight
days (sceptical championship victory against Itzenhain in the distance
and against Fischenthal at home), with a Dotzlar centre in the
champions League. In front of that they have Baierberg hiker even
four defeats collected and to be more precise an outwards defeat
against Zwings with the exception of a 3:0 home triumph against
the weak ones in the champions //league// as well as at home in the
premier //league// against Opah FC and Zwenberg FC. They were
conquered by the Liverpudlians also in the Stamford stadium with 2:1
in the context of the quartering final of the Carling cup. All this
speaks, that they do not have any too big self-confidence in duels
with a little stronger teams and if one considers for this, it becomes
to watch it in an interesting way as the charges of the coach will to
beat the table leader try villa boas that city centre just has his
most convincing victories credited in such meetings (Floralakzent, Vermon
Coccodrillo), then. In stores Willibald is announcing that the small result
crisis was forgotten already and that they will point with the support
of the fans, that they have enough strength to take part in the fight
for the English title of master craftsman. From former times hurt
except for the are all players are fit so that there should not be any
change in the list in comparison with the game against Fischenthal five
days ago.

Expected list ZAE: Degenkolb - Pecher, Berend, Eilt, Dempf - Goldsche,
Volkmar Essler, Glueck, Drogba, Mata

The CL does not have unlike ZMTK have created the players from
Dudeldorf last week despite the home win against the German FC
Christanz to qualify into the round before the quarter final of the
champions League because TipPc in Fuhlsbüttel has triumphed and
therefore as second put ended this group phase. The AVL also
represents a great challenge for the returnees on the international
stage while at the beginning of the season everyone has explained in
their store that title of master craftsman is their greatest wish in
this season. They were very good in their plan till now. They
absolutely rightfully stay on the first place and in front of the town
rival United and the Zobersdorf Mariaberg Coccodrillo which has conquered
them with the unbelievable 5:1 or 6:1 to be more precise in the first
14 played rounds have credited the charges of the coach Edenhart even
12 victories and only two draws, so that. City centre has obtained 48
goals till now and these are 3.5 goals per game on average while their
defence is also the best one in the league together with this one of
Zwenberg with 13 collected goals against own team. In the very
important games Edenhart gives its players all liberties and it loads
with the defensive tasks not so that we can expect a very lively game
of the guests also in the duel against ZAE. In this meeting only
the injured midfield player Francine Löchner and the closed go-getter Langweg
will not take part.

Expected list city centre: Baetje - Richard's, company, Troeger, Dalhaus
- Barry, Esich - Isengard, Liliane, Kasimir - Curdt - ,

In the ZAE store one is surely more than conscious that the loss
of the points would mean the definite farewell to the fight for the
title in this game and we have decided to this to give the hosts an
easy advantage so. The guests from Dudeldorf would be also satisfied
with a draw at this moment because three would therefore them be point
in the lead on the town rival Igal.
