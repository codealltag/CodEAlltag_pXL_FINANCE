WARNING: This is just another one of those scammers who are trying to
sell you stolen and modified software. He has just spammed a large amount
of newsgroups in his quest for suckers.

In the past, he has clearly advertised his intention to engage in
software piracy. His admission of his criminal intent and the sneaky way
he is going about it should be enough of a warning about his dishonesty.

Do not become another victim to the many scams in these newsgroups.
