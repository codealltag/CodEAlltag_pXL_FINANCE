WARNING: This is an organized scam to rip you off! These people are
skilled at convincing you to trust them. If you haven't been paying
attention to the news, the Eastern European criminal empire is thriving.
These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high
likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your
protected account information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive email from these people, do not respond to
it. They can collect additional information from your email headers.

If you receive any unsolicited email from this person or any other
members of this organized gang, either submit it as spam or send me the
message with the complete headers and I will do it for you.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims. This organized gang is
not here to help you, they are only here for criminal intent.
