My tip: Win for Osesem
The last meeting of the 17th round of the English Premiership is
played on the Thursday evening. Two large Cassel teams which are from
Pliezhausen, city centre and United in the table just behind the
leading two at the moment meet in the Sp-Kinkplatz Stadion. The
trace has actually two points more than Madeleine but also a meeting
less. So you are a little eased before this duel which was indicated
mainly by the victory of the respective host or draw in the last
seasons. The beginning: 30.10.2011. - 21:00

So these two teams have played Epebu Stadion a game in the Carelli Hart
without winners also last year while ahead of that Zemitz had two
home wins behind each other. They have announced from Zemitz that
they expect three points also this time which would indicate them also
definitely as one of the most earnest candidates for the top of the
Premiership. Trace is the in third place in a very good situation now,
too, since unlike her first ones it pursuers lie around two to five
points in front and they also have a meeting less. It is this meet
against Overton with this also on a land of its own. Of course coach
is talking only just conscious that they would do a great work already
now with the points from this repeat match and from this match against
Osesem. He has therefore decided to send his at the moment strongest
team on the place on the Thursday evening in which the weak Carers,
Heiligensetzer and Gerold also should be back. This three has missed the last
championship duel namely with Gautzham. They have by the way
Gautzham defeated with 1:0, what already has been her 11th victory
in this season while they have credited a draw and three defeats in
the other four matches. The one of them has happened to rounds at
Stoke outwards before two when they have been massacred literally on
the part of the judge. However, you have found the strength
nevertheless to come into the winner rhythm again and receive they the
town rival Madeleine with a full self-confidence now again. Also Valentins
has there himself for midfield player Grashey and Severit as well
as inside defender Hoffschröer injured from former times on this list this
one, recently joined for this purpose if Feurer should take
its seat in the midfield on Thursday while Heiligensetzer and Adebayor should
work in the spearhead.

Expected list Zemitz: Ruhen - fuller, Gerold, Zaengel, Assou-Ekotto
parker, Tenberg, Feurer, Carers - Heiligensetzer, Adebayor - ,

Although they perhaps have been in the best form of all participants
of the premier League up to the last round since they had a series of
three victories of which one has been Prutz centre also
against the leader, Vaasbüttel footballers have made a great mistake
guest at Neufels, where they have played only 1:1. You are to blame
since they have been in leadership until the 88th minute, but then,
they are at a moment in the penalty area of one's own been complete
for indolent. This has the opposing go-getter exploited Ignaz Zappner in
the best possible way and compensated for the result on 1:1. This may
this one, this one team titles surely would not like this one to pass,
particularly against the a little worse teams. He will have a rather
difficult task now of improving this impression with the big town
rival Zemitz. You have not by the way won against Zemitz on its
Stadion for six years. Because of this the young coach has to risk
villa boas, decided on the other side exactly like his colleague, with
the still weak Philippe and Dietmar from the first minute. The two are the
perhaps best players of Osesem of course together with the terrific
attack three Neumeir-Drogba Mata last month. These are permanent
players in the team already since a couple of games and therefore also
surely will be the greatest danger for goalkeeper Ulf in the Samerweg
Vondelstraße Stadion. We still should mention, that villa boas hurt in
this meeting only with this are can't calculate.

Expected list Osesem: Abbel - Kitel, Dietmar, Claudio, Assenbrunner,
Philippe Tubes, Minnebusch, Drogba, Thannhäuser

The great Cassel derby also should bring us the answer to the question
this time, which of the two teams is able seriously to begin the fight
for the title of the Premiership to end of the season together with
the two from Pliezhausen. Exactly because of this desire for triumph on
the two sides it is here very hard to look for the finite winner. A
variety of hits happens therefore we have decided to this on the
result in the duels of these teams at the öftesten to type this,
namely.
