d+m Zweiräder has hijacked our company's primary domain "DFW"
We simply cannot compete with DWG armada of attorneys and public
relations propaganda machine thus we are liquidating our Virtual Assets.

A recent ruling actually awarded DHA  100K+ in legal fees and
our primary domain name "DFW" Obviously we are appealing, but we need
help.

See:  http://xil.etp for details.

The latest virtual domain we are liquidating is, ZWX.ASI, at public auction
on eBAY.

If you are interested in placing a bid on http://tia.inr ; here is the the
direct link:

We felt you should know what is going on here as it could affect all of us.
Thanks in advance for your patience and concern.

Please forward this message as appropriate; we've got to get the word out.

Sincerely,
