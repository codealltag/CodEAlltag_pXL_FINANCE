WARNING: This is an organized scam to rip you off! These people are
skilled at convincing you to trust them. If you haven't been paying
attention to the news, the Eastern European criminal empire is thriving.
These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high
likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your
protected account information at predetermined times. Bulgaria in
particular appears to support and encourage these fraudulent activities.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
