WARNING: This FX is part of an organized gang ithat continues to commit
fraud! These people are skilled at convincing you to trust them. If you
haven't been paying attention to the news, the Eastern European criminal
empire is thriving. These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and not
in the US ( as if it would matter) like this con-artist would like you to
believe. There is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses
programmed to distribute your protected account information at
predetermined times.

Until DARIUS had his last protected account killed, he was collecting
information from people who visited his site. That same data collection
process is still in place. He then uses those peoples isp's and other
information in his criminal activities.  If you receive email from these
people, do not respond to it. They can collect additional information
from your email headers.

If you receive any unsolicited email from this person or any other
members of this organized gang submit it as spam to the proper
authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims. This organized gang is
not here to help you, they are only here for criminal intent.
