financial software Development (Design and develop software for stock 
market management, computerization of bank processes, computer science 
applied to economy in general).

I'm Italian Computer Science Engineering Student Looking for a company 
in which work for few months (and maybe staying after) for preparing my 
Master thesis, which I would like to be in the field said above.

Curriculum Vitae and asking possibilities about this project.
