WARNING: sggnwy@doctor is part of the same organized gang committing
international fraud! These people are skilled at convincing you to trust
them. If you haven't been paying attention to the news, the Eastern
European criminal empire is thriving. These programs were cracked in
Eastern Europe and there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan
Horses programmed to distribute your protected account information at
predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these crooks,
report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
