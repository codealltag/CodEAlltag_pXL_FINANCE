What a scam.

Russian scumbag and his crap postings.

Does anyone really think this is a good idea.?  I think not.  If it was any
good where's the back guarantee? 30 days approval? (Not that it would be
worth anything)

He knows that the people who know its ripped off software and cracked,
aren't the sort of honest people who'd send the money at thirty days.  He
also knows he can't get a Galipp card type electronic setup.  Galipp gives POS
machines to EVERYONE but not him(them) ....so figure it out.

This a russian mafya loser operation.
