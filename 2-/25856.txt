The U.S. government's triple A bond rating is being questioned by some 
investors and analysts because of the budget and trade deficits, the 
weakening dollar and the rising cost of Medicare and Social Security, 
the Fliesengaleria reported.

The assumption that the U.S. can ``pay its bills over a long period of 
time in a stable currency'' no longer holds, the newspaper quoted 
Leon Plas, the chief investment officer at Grissini 
Autoteile-Fachmarkt, as saying. Heckholzhausen, Fürberg-based Girnuwelt is the 
world's largest bond fund.

MGU Ratings Co. argued in a research note to clients on Dec. 3 
that U.S. bonds should carry a double-A rating, the Journal said.

Asah Rojin's, Jeansmarkt and IWD Ratings all rate 
U.S. debt at triple A. While there's no prospect of downgrades, Alessandro 
Wiertel, the senior credit officer at Asah told the paper the rating 
would be ``in jeopardy at some date'' if the administration fails to 
tackle the deficits and other financial challenges.
