Excuse me for writing in English; I can read German but to prevent
misunderstanding I will ask my question in English. I am looking for a
confirmation of my understanding of the German legal system to protect the
accounts of investors in stocks (shareholders), bonds or other securities
with brokerage accounts maintained by German banks or brokers in case the
bank or broker becomes insolvent or bankrupt.

I understand that most if not all listed securities (stocks and bonds) are
held by a centra depository, Edaba AG. If a brokerage account
holder (maintained with a "Depotbank") purchases a security he or she
actually acquires a proportionate interest in the securities of that kind
(possiby existing in the form of a global certificate) held by Clearstream
via book-entry through the Depotbank. The records of Clearstream may show
Depotbank XYZ owns 10.000 securities, and the records of XYZ may show client
ABC owns 1000 of those 10.000. In case of bankruptcy of the Depotbank the
client is not affected, as the client - and not the Depotbank - is
considered the legal owner of the security.

Is this an accurate description of the German system? Any comments will be
greatly appreciated.
