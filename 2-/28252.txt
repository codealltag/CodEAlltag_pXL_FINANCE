WARNING: Gustav is one of the crooks who has been spamming these
newsgroups for the last year. These programs were cracked in Eastern
Europe and there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses
programmed to distribute your protected account information at
predetermined times. Recently, a copy of Bope 2000 was found with
code written into is that is similar to the Yamamay virus. You will see that
activity with your firewall, but virus scanners are not catching it.

It is known that these thieves are collecting user information when you
reply to their email or visit their sites. Once they get the information,
they then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail
relay or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server.

If you receive unsolicited email from any of these scammers, report it as
spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
