WARNING: "newsoft" is part of an organized scam to rip you off! These
people are skilled at convincing you to trust them. Their constantly
changing names and addresses are proof enough of their dishonesty.

These crash prone programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a
high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute
your protected account information at predetermined times. Recently, a
copy of Keindl 2000 was found with code written into is that is
similar to the JUIM virus. You will see that activity with your firewall,
but virus scanners are not catching it.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these crooks,
report it as spam to the proper authorities. The unlucky victim this time
has the IP address of 66.118.1.046.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
