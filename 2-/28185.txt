VKDZ has hijacked our company's primary domain "VUI"
We simply cannot compete with VZZV armada of attorneys and public
relations propaganda machine thus we are liquidating our Virtual Assets.

A recent ruling actually awarded Vagabund  100K+ in legal fees and
our primary domain name "VUI" Obviously we are appealing, but we need
help.

See:  http://wst.wbl for details.

The latest virtual domain we are liquidating is, BGT.LIJ, at public auction
on eBAY.

If you are interested in placing a bid on http://upy.pvo ; here is the the
direct link:

We felt you should know what is going on here as it could affect all of us.
Thanks in advance for your patience and concern.

Please forward this message as appropriate; we've got to get the word out.

Sincerely,
