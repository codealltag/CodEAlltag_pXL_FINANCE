WARNING: This person is part of an organized scam to rip you off! Both
devil_softw and "trade4_yy (and other "trade__" names) are the same
person. His constantly changing addresses and names should be a clear
indication of his dishonesty. These programs were cracked in Eastern
Europe and there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses
programmed to distribute your protected account information at
predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these crooks,
report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
