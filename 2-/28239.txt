WARNING: All of these names belong to the same crook; dwane, pcnerd and
newsoftware. He also uses many other different names so he can claim that
he is not the person who either ripped you off or sold you software that
does not operate as it was originally designed. He is part of the same
gang that is intentionally flooding these newsgroups with spam. They know
that even if a few people are dumb enough to send money, that is enough
of a reason to keep looking for more suckers.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. They then use either your system or that of your ISP to post
their messages. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these
crooks, report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
