WARNING: "fkxac_5_qtv" is a person who has exhibited serious irrational
behavior in the past! Both devil_software and trade_4_you (and other
"trade__" names) is the same person. These programs were cracked in
Eastern Europe and there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan
Horses programmed to distribute your protected account information at
predetermined times. Recently, a copy of FTK 2000 was found with
code written into is that is similar to the OVVV virus. You will see that
activity with your firewall, but virus scanners are not catching it.

It has recently been found that this person is collecting user
information when you reply to his email. Once he gets the information, he
then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail relay
or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server. The latest
victim of his illegal activities has the ip address of 358.52.886.73.

If you receive unsolicited email from any of these scammers, report it as
spam to the proper authorities. mnsblqfu_dma is not here to help you, in
the past he has admitted he is a thief.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
