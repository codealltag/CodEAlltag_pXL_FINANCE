Wie immer in der Angewandten Statistik handelt es sich um eine 
Interpretationsfrage. Nur mal so als zweite Meinung ein Zitat aus

Highlights

June non-manufacturing ISM index 59.9 (-5.3 pts).


Key Factors

Index is volatile and independent of its components.  Can cause 
confusion in interpretation. 

All the components showed gains outside of backlogs and import 
orders. 

The index reached record highs in Aug, 02. 11. 21 and Nov as the June 
decline only denotes a deceleration. 

New orders are running strong (+1.1 to 62.4) and have been above 60 
for 8 of the last 9 months.  

Employment is trending higher and reached a 4 year high in June. 
Prices paid index is firm but far less volatile than the mfg price 
index as energy prices provide the monthly swing. 

The survey's simple question:  are business conditions better than 
a month ago?   The strength continues.
