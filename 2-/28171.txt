WARNING: This is an organized scam to rip you off! These people are
skilled at convincing you to trust them. Their constantly changing names
and addresses are proof enough of their integrity. These programs were
cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high likelihood that they
contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your protected account
information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these crooks,
report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
