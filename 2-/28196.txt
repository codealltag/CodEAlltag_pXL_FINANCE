WARNING: This gang is part of an organized scam to rip you off!  Their
recent coordinated activities at spamming newsgroups clearly show their
organized nature. These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there
is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to
distribute your protected account information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that these persons are collecting user
information when you reply to their email. Once they get the information,
they then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail
relay or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server.
Webmasters have seen a pattern of attacks correspond to people answering
email or contacting these crooks. If you receive unsolicited email from
any of these scammers, report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
