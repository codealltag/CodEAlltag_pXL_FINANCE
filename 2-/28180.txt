WARNING: This person is irrational and is part of an organized scam to
rip you off! Both devilprgs and "trade4_yy (and other "trade__" names)
are the same person. His constantly changing addresses and names should
be a clear indication of his dishonesty. If you haven't been paying
attention to the news, the Eastern European criminal empire is thriving.
These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high
likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your
protected account information at predetermined times.

It has recently been found that several members of this gang are
collecting user information when you visit their websites or reply to
their email. If you receive unsolicited email from one of these crooks,
report it as spam to the proper authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
