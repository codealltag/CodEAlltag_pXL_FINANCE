WARNING: This FX is part of an organized gang ithat continues to commit
fraud! These people are skilled at convincing you to trust them. If you
haven't been paying attention to the news, the Eastern European criminal
empire is thriving. These programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and
there is a high likelihood that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to
distribute your protected account information at predetermined times.

Until CHRISTOPH had his last protected account killed, he was collecting
information from people who visited his site. That information was then
used to use those peoples isp's and other information in his criminal
activities.  If you receive email from these people, do not respond to
it. They can collect additional information from your email headers.

If you receive any unsolicited email from this person or any other
members of this organized gang submit it as spam to the proper
authorities.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims. This organized gang is
not here to help you, they are only here for criminal intent.
