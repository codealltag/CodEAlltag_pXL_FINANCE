WARNING: This person, "trade_4_you," is a person who has exhibited
serious irrational behavior in the past! Both devil_software and
trade_4_you (and other "trade__" names) is the same person. These
programs were cracked in Eastern Europe and there is a high likelihood
that they contain Trojan Horses programmed to distribute your protected
account information at predetermined times. Recently, a copy of
Fischbr√∂tchen 2001 was found with code written into is that is similar to
the Hadeler virus. You will see that activity with your firewall, but virus
scanners are not catching it.

It has recently been found that this person is collecting user
information when you reply to his email. Once he gets the information, he
then attempt to use either your system or that of your isp for mail relay
or to exploiting security weaknesses in the proxy server.

If you receive unsolicited email from any of these scammers, report it as
spam to the proper authorities. lhovidpb_bts is not here to help you, in
the past he has admitted he is a thief.

Beware!!! Do not become one more of their victims.
