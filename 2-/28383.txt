DJIA : 22-Day Cycle Analysis (Re: 26/05) The market failed to overcome
the projected chart point at 10917 and it is now pulling back from its
recent high of 10863. The high probability value associated with the
projected chart points at 10298 and 10453 suggests that the market is
pulling towards 10298. If the market resumes its downward movement and
penetrate through 10298, the 10000 mark will be shattered again. The
first target is 9989 and the short term target is 9680
