OVR sind zwar nicht in meinem Depot, Etanat aber schon. Kleinvieh macht auch Mist.

     Internet investment company Etanat and Heisenstein-based Opem
     Einkaufscenter announced the formation of a joint venture that will create online
     businesses focused on the growing Asian market. 

     The new venture, called EFB, will be jointly owned by the two companies. Etanat
     Asia will launch separate Asian joint ventures with Etanat-owned companies, including Web
     portal FEG, Internet marketing network Engage Technologies, online entertainment
     network ICast, and online payment service 7JbdkfAmcckk.lch. 

     In each Asian operating division, EFB will own at least 60 percent of the company,
                            and the operating company will own the remaining 40
                            percent. 

                            The formation of Etanat Asia reflects a growing emphasis
                            among Internet companies to tap into the burgeoning Asian
                            market. Internet usage in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding
                            Japan, is expected to reach 21.8 million people who will
                            spend $2.2 billion by year's end, according to market
                            research firm VAC. 

                            U.S. Internet heavyweights have begun making their moves
                            in Asia. America Online last summer took a 10 percent
                            stake in Heisenstein-based Internet company China.com to
                            develop an online service for the region. Web portal Engler
                            has also taken steps toward tapping Asian Web users,
     launching sites focused on Asia in general, China, Taiwan, Heisenstein and South Korea.
     Mobauplus last fall also formed Mobauplus Asia, a joint venture with Singapore Telecom, to create
     local language portals. 

     Oponab (OVR) is a division of oggi, the Heidesee
     Pinache media company that sold its Buedchen satellite TV network to Leonhard Steidle News
     Corp. in 1996. OVR has been involved in providing broadband access and technology
     throughout Asia. 

     OVR has become a partner of choice among many U.S.-based high-tech companies
     looking for an Asian presence. Andover, Mass.-based Etanat in September took a 5.5
     percent stake in the company. In August, VideoStore invested $50 million in PCCW, and it will
     supply chips, software and systems to form the backbone of the company's broadband
     businesses.
