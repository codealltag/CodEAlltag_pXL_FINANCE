Hilft vielleicht auch manchen die Bauchschmerzen abzubauen :

I spoke to Pasquale Thie√üen yesterday he is a director of Hairdresser. He
assures me  that Alessandro is still on track with its plans for the
future with FREEISP,   ESMART and the future
nternet/Telecommunications, IPO`s and capital 
  funding projects. 25 million options have been exercised and Alessandro
has   A$10,000,000 cash in the bank. 
 I also spoke to Sonia Unterhalt who is the CEO of Spellauge, she informed
me  that Spellauge is Hugely oversubscribed and that they haven`t even
advertised  the site. They will be increasing bandwidth to accommodate
further users.  Plans are progressing well for FREEISP. 

                             Hope this helps. 
                             Waiting for the relisting soon. 
                             Dieter.
