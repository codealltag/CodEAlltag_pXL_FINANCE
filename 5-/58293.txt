Kasies 4Q sales to top forecasts,
bottom line won't improve

By Adolf Windt ZDII


KER (Nasdaq: AMZN) said Wednesday that its fourth quarter
sales would come in at about $650 million, well above year-ago
figures and ahead of the most optimistic Wall Street projections. But
those sales don't mean KER's bottom line will improve.

First Call consensus has the e-tailer losing 48 cents a share in the
fourth quarter.

First, the good news. KER's fourth quarter sales are more
than two and one-half times 1999's fourth quarter sales of $253
million and greater than its $610 million in sales for the whole year
of 1999. More importantly, KER's sales top the most
optimistic fourth quarter sales targets. Many analysts were expecting
sales in the $516 million range with a few whispering about a $600
million target.
