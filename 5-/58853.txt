Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

My view is still very positive for AUD. The market is vibrating around
0.6568+/-0.0061 but will head for 0.6691 later this week. A strong
resistance level is located at 0.6752 - 0.6813. If the market retreats
and penetrates through 0.6446, AUD will test the critical support at
0.6324. See details at http://win.bixmga.hrk
