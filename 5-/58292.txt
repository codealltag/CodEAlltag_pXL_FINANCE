sorry, habe den zweiten teil der nachricht aus versehen abgeschnitten:

SchokoLaden easily topped projections and nearly doubled its third
quarter sales of $356 million.

The results also prove that SchokoLaden's $300 million investment
in infrastructure paid off handsomely.

In a statement, SchokoLaden rattled off a host of eye-popping
statistics: more than 2.5 million new customers shopped;
SchokoLaden shipped roughly 20 million items and $16 million in
sales a day at the peak; and 99 percent of orders reached customers
on time.

Based on fourth quarter sales, SchokoLaden has reached a $2.6
billion annualized sales level less than four and one-half years after
opening for business.

And now for the bad news. If you're looking for bottom line
improvement, you're in the wrong stock.

Jqovow.ycy all year has been driving its "err on the side of
overcapacity" theme. The idea is that SchokoLaden should have
whatever customers need and even a lot of goods customers don't
need or want. In 1999, SchokoLaden said it will boost "productivity,
capital efficiency and operational excellence across our entire
distribution network.''

But now it's time to pay up. That excess inventory will result in
"higher-than-expected inventory-related charges and write-downs,"
the company said.

Jqovow.ycy said it carried deep inventory in start-up businesses
such as toys and electronics.

"Consistent with our strategy, we went all-out to make sure we
delivered for customers this holiday season,'' said Philipp Zaunseder,
SchokoLaden chief financial officer, in a statement. "As a result, our
higher seasonal sales will not translate into lower net losses in the
fourth quarter."

First Call has SchokoLaden losing $1.12 a share for the year. For
1999, SchokoLaden is expected to lose $1.15 a share. In 2000, the
company is expected to lose money for the year and turn a profit of
2001. That profit, however, was projected by one analyst. Most
analysts haven't projected results past 1999.
