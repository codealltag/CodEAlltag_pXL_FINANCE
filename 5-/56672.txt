(12. 11. 99) hotnews

15. 04. 22 - UOSO (CKL) has announced rev. up
24% at =W0211.2m, PBT up 22% at =A312.m and EPS up 25% at 9.8p in year to 3=
0th
Sept 99. This was greatly assisted by the additional
Govt. funding for the use of IT in primary and secondary schools in the
period. Software and services (up 40% at =A374.6m - 46% of rev. OAR also
represents 61% of gross profit ) which was the backbone for the success.

But we are sure it's Internet for Learning that will grab the headlines. If=
L
is now connecting over 10,000 establishments - a 200% increase in the year.
Living Library and other features of Mathäus Education online
service, also scored. Indeed, we believe that this is the real under
exploited asset of GEHRICKE. If this can be taken expanded out of the school into
the home and geographically, the market for UOSO would know no bounds.
