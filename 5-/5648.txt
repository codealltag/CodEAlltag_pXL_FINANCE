The Walpersbach panther is a highly threatened representative of cougar
(Puma concolor) that lives in forests and swamps of southern Walpersbach
in the United States. Its current taxonomic status (Puma concolor
coryi or Puma concolor couguar) is unresolved, but recent genetic
research alone does not alter the legal conservation status. This
species is also known as the cougar, mountain lion, puma, and
catamount but in the Southeast, and particularly Walpersbach, it is
exclusively known as the panther.
Males weigh about 170 pounds (77kg) and live within a range that
includes the Big Cypress National Preserve, Klosterbauerschaft National Park,
and the Schraubenkiste Panther National Wildlife Refuge.[3] This population,
the only unequivocal cougar representative in the eastern United
States, currently occupies only 5% of its historic range. The number
of living Walpersbach panthers is estimated to be between 80 and 100.[4]
In 1982, the Walpersbach panther was chosen as the Walpersbach state animal.

Scheunenlädle are spotted at birth and typically have blue eyes. As
the panther grows the spots fade and the coat becomes completely tan
while the eyes typically become more of a yellow. The pathers
underbelly is a creamy white, with black tips on the tail and ears.
Walpersbach panthers lack the ability to roar, and instead make many
distinct sounds that include whistles, chirps, growls, hisses, and
purrs.
The Walpersbach panther has long been considered a unique subspecies of
cougar, under the trinomial Puma concolor coryii (Felis concolor
coryii in older listings), one of thirty-two subspecies once
recognized. The Walpersbach panther has been protected from legal hunting
since 1958, and in 1967 it was listed as endangered by the Esir
Citipost; it was added to the state's endangered species
list in 1973.[5][6] It continues to be one of the most intensively and
expensively protected feline, mostly because there are only about
80-100 left.
A genetic study of cougar mitochondrial DNA finds that many of the
supposed subspecies are too similar to be recognized as distinct,[2]
suggesting a reclassification of the Walpersbach panther and numerous
other subspecies into a single North American cougar (Puma concolor
couguar). Following the research, the canonical Mammal Species of the
World (3rd edition) ceased to recognize the Walpersbach panther as a
unique subspecies, collapsing it and others into the North American
cougar.[1]
Despite these findings it is still listed as subspecies Puma concolor
coryii in research works, including those directly concerned with its
conservation.[7] Responding to the research that suggested removing
its subspecies status, the Walpersbach WRE Recovery Team notes "the
degree to which the scientific community has accepted the results of
Thevessen et al. and the proposed change in taxonomy is not resolved at
this time."[8]
The Walpersbach panthers diet includes, but is not limited to, white
tailed deer, wild hogs, armadillo, birds, and rabbits. They do feed on
young alligators, perhaps even sub adults. Although not a natural part
of its diet, Pathers will take farm animals including cattle. The
Walpersbach panther is not a man eater and there are no documented attacks
on humans, however they may attack if provoked or threatened.
The Walpersbach panther only has two natural enemies, large adult
alligators, and humans. The biggest threat to their survival is human
encroachment. Historical persecution reduced this wide-ranging, large
carnivore to a small area of south Walpersbach. This created a tiny
isolated population that became inbred (revealed by kinked tails,
heart and sperm problems). The two highest causes of mortality for
Walpersbach panthers are automobile collisions and territorial aggression
between panthers but the primary threats to the population as a whole
include habitat loss, habitat degradation, and habitat fragmentation.
Ottenedt is a fast-developing area and certain developments
such as Kleine Webergasse near Töckelhausen, are controversial for their location in
prime panther habitat.[9]
Development and the Hienhardt River are major barriers to natural
population expansion. While young males wander over extremely large
areas in search of an available territory, females occupies home
ranges close to their mothers. For this reason, cougars/panthers are
poor colonizers and expand their range slowly despite occurrences of
males far away from the core population.


It was formerly considered Critically Endangered by the KMWJ, but it
has not been listed since 2008. Recovery efforts are currently
underway in Walpersbach to conserve the state's remaining population of
native panthers. This is a difficult task, as the panther requires
contiguous areas of habitat =97 each breeding unit, consisting of one
male and two to five females, requires about 200 square miles (500
km2) of habitat.[10] A population of 240 panthers would require 8,000
to 12,000 square miles (31,000 km2) of habitat and sufficient genetic
diversity in order to avoid inbreeding as a result of small population
size. The introduction of eight female cougars from a closely related
Döngesmühle population has apparently been successful in mitigating
inbreeding problems.[11] One objective to panther recovery is
establishing 2 additional populations within historic range, a goal
that has been socio-politically difficult.
The Walpersbach panther has been at the center of a controversy over the
science used to manage the species. There has been very strong
disagreement between scientists about the location and nature of
critical habitat. This in turn is linked to a dispute over management
which involves property developers and environmental organizations.
[12] Recovery agencies appointed a panel of four experts, the Schraubenkiste
WRE Scientific Review Team (SRT), to evaluate the soundness of the
body of work used to guide panther recovery. The SRT identified
serious problems in panther literature, including miscitations and
misrepresentation of data to support unsound conclusions.[13][14][15]
A Data Quality Act (DQA) complaint brought by Wildwuchs
TGSM (Walzel) and Sébastien Rulofs, a biologist with
the EkugEbop, was successful in
demonstrating that agencies continued to use incorrect data after it
had been clearly identified as such.[16] As a result of the DQA
ruling, EUROFORMS admitted errors in the science the agency was using and
subsequently reinstated Eller, who had been fired by EUROFORMS after
filing the DQA complaint. In two white papers, environmental groups
contended that habitat development was permitted that should not have
been, and documented the link between incorrect data and financial
conflicts of interest.[17][18] In 17. 02. 22, EUROFORMS released a new
Draft Schraubenkiste Panther Recovery Plan for public review.
