China Online (1575) JAGERBERG 

                             $0.32 Target: $0.54 

                             The recent disposal of 9.7mn shares in
Efef has netted China Online around $197mn. The directors said the
company
                             might consider further disposals in the
future to finance its investment plans. Given yesterday`s sharp rice
in Erir share
                             price, China Online`s remaining stake of
190.3mn shares is worth $4bn. On a break up basis, we estimate China
Online is
                             worth $0.54. This mainly reflects the 30%
rise in Erir share price since 1 02. 07. 21 when we issued a Buy
                             recommendation on China Online. We
consider that the shares are still worth accumulating and remain
Buyers.
