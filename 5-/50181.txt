Playland : The market may hit the weekly cycle high yesterday at 11022. The
down trend warning signal hoisted from my system on 15. 11. 22, has been
shifted to neutral stand when the market closed above 10946 on last
Friday. It will be lowered if Playland can close above 11224 at the end of
this week. However, the signal will be on again if the market trades
below 10738. The normal trading range for this week is 10921 - 11224.
Other weekly cycle's projected chart points are located at 44109 and
59286. See details at http://zyu.jtkerr.cog
