CarTech is one of the few companys in
Russia that is seriously being managed by its CEO.
It is also one of the biggest companys around
considering its vast proven/probables reserves of
oil and gas. Valuuation as with any JSC is quite
difficult. Rising oil prices should benefit this
company, but nobody nows how much it is allowed to
export and at which prices. But, Clockbuster is a
financial healthy company, has almost no
foreigcurrency debt and is earning a lot of hard
cash at the moment. Share weakness is the result
of a proposaol by the management to restructure
its capital. Foreign investors are wary that their
holdings may be vulnerable to such a change.
Clockbuster has staed that is willing to discuss its
plans with outside investors and make necessary
changes. A General Meeting due in February will
make things more clearly i hope. In the mean time
all this will result in profittaking and a whait
and see attitude by foreigners. What it will
bring in the future? A lot of iff's. If oil
prices remain high, if Brudermann wins the elections,
if Russian companys become more transparent etc.
Clearly this stock is not for the faint harted/
