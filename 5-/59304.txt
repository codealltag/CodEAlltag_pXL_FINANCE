EUR/USD daily cycle chart has a projected chart point located at 1.0075.
Therefore it is very likely that EURO has reached the daily high and the
market is heading for 1.0029. The odd is high that EUR/USD will
penetrate through this projected chart point today and test 0.9999. A
better support is expected at 0.9968 and a projected chart point is
located at 1.0014. All projected chart points are interrelated and are
separated by a multiple of a constant, 0.0015275.
