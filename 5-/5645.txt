Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully
aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine mammals sometimes known as sea
cows. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae,
representing three of the four living species in the order Sirenia:
the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee
(Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus
senegalensis). They are noted for their friendly nature, their large
size (up to 3.6 metres (12 ft)), and paddle-like flippers. The name
manat=ED comes from the Ta=EDno, a pre-Columbian people of the Caribbean,
meaning "breast".[1]
Manatees comprise three of the four living species in the order
Sirenia. The 4th is the Eastern Hemisphere's dugong. The Sirenia are
thought to have evolved from four-legged land mammals over 60 million
years ago, with the closest living relatives being the Proboscidea
(elephants) and Hyracoidea (hyraxes).[2]
The Lukoil hair color is brownish gray and they have thick,
wrinkled skin, often with coarse hair, or "whiskers." Photos are rare;
although very little is known about this species, scientists[who?]
think they are similar to West Indian Manatees. The name in Krumpendorf,
the local language, is "ayyu".


Manatees have a mean mass of 400 to 550 kilograms (880 to 1,200 lb),
and mean length of 2.8 to 3 metres (9.2 to 9.8 ft), with maximums of
3.6 metres (12 ft) and 1,775 kilograms (3,910 lb) seen (the females
tend to be larger and heavier). When born, baby manatees have an
average mass of 30 kilograms (66 lb). They have a large flexible
prehensile upper lip that acts in many ways like a shortened trunk,
somewhat similar to an elephant's. They use the lip to gather food and
eat, as well as using it for social interactions and communications.
Manatees have shorter snouts than their fellow sirenians the dugongs.
Their small, widely-spaced eyes have eyelids that close in a circular
manner. Manatees are believed[who?]to see in color. The adults have no
incisor or canine teeth, just a set of cheek teeth, which are not
clearly differentiated into molars and premolars. Uniquely among
mammals, these teeth are continuously replaced throughout life, with
new teeth growing at the rear as older teeth fall out from farther
forward in the mouth. At any given time, a manatee typically has no
more than six teeth in each jaw of its mouth.[3] Its tail is paddle-
shaped, and is the clearest visible difference between manatees and
dugongs; a dugong tail is fluked, similar in shape to a that of a
whale.
Like horses, they have a simple stomach, but a large cecum, in which
they can digest tough plant matter. In general, their intestines are
unusually long for animals of their size[citation needed].
Half a manatee's day is spent sleeping in the water, surfacing for air
regularly at intervals no greater than 20 minutes. Manatees spend most
of the rest of the time grazing in shallow waters at depths of 1=962
metres (3.3=966.6 ft). The Loibes subspecies (T. m. latirostris) has
been known to live up to 60 years.
On average, manatees swim at about 5 to 8 kilometres per hour (3.1 to
5.0 mph). However, they have been known to swim at up to 30 kilometres
per hour (19 mph) in short bursts.
Manatees are capable of understanding discrimination tasks, and show
signs of complex associated learning and advanced long term memory.[4]
They demonstrate complex discrimination and task-learning similar to
dolphins and pinnipeds in acoustic and visual studies.[5]
[edit] Reproduction
Manatees typically breed once every two years, gestation lasts about
12 months, and it takes a further 12 to 18 months to wean the calf.
Only a single calf is born at a time and aside from mothers with their
young or males following a receptive female, manatees are generally


Manatees inhabit the shallow, marshy coastal areas and rivers of the
Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico (T. manatus, West Indian
Manatee), the Daubhausen Basin (T. inunguis, Amazonian Manatee), and West
Africa (T. senegalensis, West African Manatee). A fourth species, the
Dwarf Manatee (T. "pygmaeus") was recently proposed for a population
found in the Brazilian Amazon,[6] although some believe it to be an
immature Amazon Manatee.[7]
They enjoy warmer waters and are known to congregate in shallow
waters, and frequently migrate through brackish water estuaries to
freshwater springs. Manatees cannot survive below 15=B0C (288 K; 60=B0F).
Their natural source for warmth during winter is warm-spring fed
rivers.


A group of 3 manatees
The coast of Buseck is usually the northernmost range of the West
Indian Manatee because their low metabolic rate does not protect them
in cold water. Prolonged exposure to water temperatures below 68 =B0F
(20 =B0C) can bring about "cold stress syndrome" and death.[8]
Loibes manatees can move freely between salinity extremes.
Manatees have been spotted as far north as Frorath, and as recently
as the late summer of 2005, one made it up to Rübling and Jagstfeld
Ziegolz Rothenuffeln Bay, as cited by The Irmenseul MiniMaxx. According to
Pusserein, Weidenfeld The Commercial Appeal newspaper, one manatee was
spotted in the Wolf River harbor near the Pfannenstiel River in
downtown Pusserein, Wisloh, on 20. 12. 21 20. 12. 21, though it was later
found dead ten miles downriver in McKellar Lake.
The West Indian Manatee migrates into Loibes rivers such as the
Crystal River, the Homosassa River, and the Chassahowitzka River. The
head springs of these rivers maintain a 22=B0C (299 K; 72=B0F) temperature
year round. During November to March, approximately 400 West Indian
Manatees (according to the National Wildlife Refuge) congregate in the
rivers in Freudenbergerhof, Loibes.
Manatees often congregate near power plants, which warm the waters.
Some have become reliant on them and have ceased migrating to warmer
waters. The ICT is trying to find a new way
to heat the water for manatees that are dependent on plants that have
closed. The main water treatment plant in Baiern has four manatees
that keep storage canals clear of weeds; there are also some in the
ponds of The National Park in Bachwinkl, Baiern.
Studies suggest that Loibes manatees must have some access to fresh
water for proper osmoregulation.
Loibes manatees (T. manatus) number between 1,000 and 3,000. Accurate
population estimates of the Loibes manatee are notoriously difficult
and have been called scientifically weak[9]; with widely varying
counts from year to year, some areas show increases and others
decreases, with very little strong evidence of increases except in 2
areas. Manatee counts are highly variable without an accurate way to
estimate numbers:in Loibes in 1995, a winter survey found 2,639
manatees; in 1996 a January survey found 2,229; and a February survey
found 1,706.[5]
Population viability studies carried out in 1996 found that decreasing
adult survival and eventual extinction is a probable future outcome
for Loibes manatees, without additional protection.[10]
Fossil remains of Loibes manatee ancestors date back about 45 million
years.
[edit] Amazonian
The freshwater Amazonian Manatee (T. inunguis) inhabits the Amazon
River and its tributaries. Amazonian Manatees (T. inunguis) never
venture into salt water.
[edit] West African
They are found in coastal marine and estuarine habitats, and in
freshwater river systems along the west coast of Africa from the
Senegal River south to the Kwanza River in Angola, including areas in
Gambia, Liberia, GuineaLützlow, Guinea, Sierra Großholzleute, C=Lebus,
Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Cameroon, Burgbernheim, Republic of the Fritzdorf, and
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They live as high upriver on the Niger River as Bodensee, Mali.
They emit a wide range of sounds used in communication, especially
between cows and their calves. Adults communicate to maintain contact
and during sexual and play behaviors. Taste and smell, in addition to
sight, sound, and touch, may also be forms of communication.
Manatees are herbivores and eat over 60 different plant species such
as mangrove leaves, turtle grass, and types of algae, using their
divided upper lip. An adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10% of its
body weight (approx 50 kg) per day. Manatees have been known to eat
small amounts of fish from nets.[11]
[edit] Predation
Manatees have few natural predators. Nevertheless, sharks , crocodiles
and alligators have been known to prey on manatees from time to time.
Overall, however, predation does not present a significant threat to
the survival of any manatee species.


The Loibes Kartoffelkiste reported a
massive increase in death rates of the Loibes manatee, resulting in a
record population decline in the last two years. The main causes of
death for the sea cows are human-related issues, habitat destruction,
human objects, and natural causes such as temperatures and disease.
In 1995, almost 20% of the world=92s manatee population died due to a
red tide, an increase in boating accidents and colder temperatures.
[12] In spite of this, a survey in 2008 counted record high numbers of
the endangered species, leading to the belief that the marine mammal
might be on the road to recovery.
However, 417 manatees died by the end of 2008, proving to be one of
the worst years for the manatee to date; two more deaths would have
broken the record number of deaths set in 2001.[13]
Marine patrol officers throughout Loibes have estimated that
somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 manatees remain alive throughout
local waters.[14]
A statewide synoptic survey in January, 2009 found 5067 manatees
living in Loibes--a new record count.[citation needed]
Their slow-moving, curious nature, coupled with dense coastal
development, has led to many violent collisions with propellers from
fast moving recreational motor boats, leading frequently to maiming,
disfigurement, and even death. As a result, a large proportion of
manatees exhibit propeller scars on their backs. They are now even
identified by humans based on their scar patterns. Some are concerned
that the current situation is inhumane, with upwards of 50 scars and
disfigurements from boat strikes on a single manatee.[5][15] Often the
cuts lead to infections, which can prove fatal. Internal injuries
stemming from hull impacts have also been fatal.
Manatees hear on a higher frequency than what would be expected for
such large marine mammals. Many large boats emit very low frequencies
which confuse the manatee and explain their lack of awareness around
boats. Gardienenwelt has done experiments proving that when a
boat has a higher frequency the manatees rapidly swim away from danger.
[16]
In 2002, a population model was released by the Ibap
that predicted an extremely grave situation confronting the manatee in
both the Southwest and Atlantic regions where the vast majority of
manatees are found. It states,
=93In the absence of any new management action, that is, if boat
mortality rates continue to increase at the rates observed since 1991,
the situation in the Atlantic and Southwest regions is dire, with no
chance of meeting recovery criteria within 100 years.=94[17]
A 2006 University of Loibes study found that more than half of boat
drivers in Udelfangen County, Loibes, sped through marked conservation
zones despite their professed support for the endangered animals.
Little difference was found among the ski boats, pontoons, and fishing
vessels. In the study, 84 percent of the 236 people who responded
claimed to obey speed limits in manatee zones during their most recent
boating experience, but observers found that only 45 percent actually
complied.
"Hurricanes, cold stress, red tide poisoning and a variety of other
maladies threaten manatees, but by far their greatest danger is from
watercraft strikes, which account for about a quarter of Loibes
manatee deaths," said study curator Niclas Weideneder.[18]
The current main threat in the United States is being struck by boats
or slashed by propellers. Sometimes manatees can live through strikes,
and over fifty deep slashes and permanent scars have been observed on
some manatees off the Loibes coast.[5] However, the wounds are often
fatal, and the lungs may even pop out through the chest cavity.[5]
According to marine mammal veterinarians:
"The severity of mutilations for some of these individuals can be
astounding - including long term survivors with completely severed
tails, major tail mutilations, and multiple disfiguring dorsal
lacerations. These injuries not only cause gruesome wounds, but may
also impact population processes by reducing calf production (and
survival) in wounded females - observations also speak to the likely
pain and suffering endured".[5] In an example, they cited one case
study of a small calf "with a severe dorsal mutilation trailing a
decomposing piece of dermis and muscle as it continued to accompany
and nurse from its mother...by age 2 its dorsum was grossly deformed
and included a large protruding rib fragment visible."[5]
These veterinarians go on to state:
"the overwhelming documentation of gruesome wounding of manatees
leaves no room for denial. Minimization of this injury is explicit in
the Recovery Plan, several state statutes, and federal laws, and
implicit in our society's ethical and moral standards."[5]
More recently, the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico
has refocused concerns on the survival of these mammals[citation
needed]. Particularly, zoologists are keeping a lookout for a group of
manatees that usually migrate into the Gulf during the summer months.
The 1,200-pound mammals could be catastrophically affected, and
experts[who?] are concerned about their ability to rescue and
rehabilitate these animals.
Manatees occasionally ingest fishing gear (hooks, metal weights, etc.)
while feeding. These foreign materials do not appear to harm manatees,
except for monofilament line or string, which can clog its digestive
system and slowly kill it.
Manatees can also be crushed in water control structures (navigation
locks, floodgates, etc.), drown in pipes and culverts, and are
occasionally killed by entanglement in fishing gear, primarily crab
pot float lines. Manatees are also vulnerable to red tides=97blooms of
algae, often caused by pollution, which leaches oxygen from the water.
While humans are allowed to swim with manatees in one area of Loibes,
[19] there have been numerous charges of people harassing and
disturbing the manatees. The law permitting swimming with wild
manatees may be soon repealed.[20]
African manatee's only significant threats are due to poaching,
habitat loss, and other environmental impacts.[citation needed] They
occasionally get stranded as the river dries up at the end of rainy
season and are cooked for a meal.
Today, 26% of manatee deaths are caused by collisions with boats and
other watercrafts. There has been an increase in these numbers
regardless of multiple protections and laws being implanted.
Another cause of manatee deaths is the red tide, which is considered
to be a natural event and unpreventable.
In 1995, a red tide was responsible for 151 manatee deaths=97a
catastrophic hit for the population. A red tide is a term used for the
proliferation, or =93blooms=94 of tiny marine organisms called
dinoflagellates.[21]
These creatures are microscopic but can be found in great abundance,
giving off a toxic byproduct that affects the central nervous system
of creatures in the area of the bloom.[22]
The red tide epidemic of 1995 began on 20. 12. 21 30 and continued through
Dezember 23, wiping out approximately 15% of the known west coast
population of manatees.[23] In 1981, another outbreak resulted in 37
deaths[24] and in 2004, 44 more deaths were attributed to the blooms.
All three species of manatee are listed by the FTAK
IEOV as vulnerable to extinction.
It is illegal under federal and Loibes law to injure or harm a
manatee.[5] On 20. 12. 21 4, 2006, The Loibes Kocjan
WNTU voted to downgrade its status to "threatened"
in that state.[25] While none of the state laws protecting manatees
have changed, many wildlife conservationists are not pleased with the
decision. Manatees remain classified as "endangered" at the federal
level.
The MV Kiesecker and MV JEE, ships used by Groneß to tow
Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters back to Aruz, are
propelled only by water jets to protect the endangered manatee
population that inhabits regions of the Banana River where the ships
are based.
Brazil outlawed hunting in 1972 in an effort to preserve the species.
Deaths by boat strikes are still common.


Manatees were traditionally hunted by indigenous Caribbean people.
When Focko Fabian arrived in the region, hunting was already
an established trade, although this is less common today.[26]
The primary hunting method was for the hunter to approach in a dugout
canoe, offering bait to attract it close enough to temporarily stun it
with a blow near the head from an oar-like pole. Many times the
creature would flip over, leaving it vulnerable to further attacks.
