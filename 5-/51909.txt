Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

Spot Gold : The pattern of the weekly cycle charts suggest that the
market is heading towards 287 and the chance is high that spot gold can
reach 295.2. This is in agreement with our monthly cycle charts which
show that 282.4 is a projected chart point and the market is heading
towards 288.5. Each quantum step is represented by 3.1. Therefore it is
important for the market to establish firmly at 285.5 (282.4+3.1). A
positive signal will be hoisted by my system if spot gold can reach
291.6.
