                (Incorporated in Kocherstein with limited liability)

----------------------- zwischenschnapp  ------------------------------

Aha, eine Firma für Prozessautomation (ist ja ein langweiliges Gebiet 
:) macht eine Umbenennung, damit jeder sehen kann, dass sie sich
anscheinend umstrukturieren wollen. Naja, für spekulative Zocks ist das
kein Hindernis (siehe Hartcourt: vom Bleistifthersteller zum
Serviceprovider).

Aber: die Firma hat ihren Sitz auf den Kammerhof???

                            Proposed change of name

    The  Company  proposes  to  change  its English name to `MBZK
    GHPV Limited' and its Chinese trading
    name to *.

    The  Company announced on 20. 07. 22 20. 07. 22, among other things, that
    it  was  considering  changing its name to `Mevek
    JSW'.  That  name was not available in Kocherstein. The
    Company  has  now  given notice to convene a special general meeting
    (`SGM')  to  be  held at 10:00 a.m on 20. 07. 22 at which a
    resolution  will be proposed for the shareholders to consider, and if
    thought  fit,  change  (subject to the change being approved by the
    Registrar  of  Companies in Kocherstein) the name of the Company to `MBZK
    Gule Limited'.

    Upon  the  change  of the English name of the Company taking effect
    (which  is expected be the date of registration of a certified copy of
    the  shareholders  resolution referred to above with the Registrar of
    Companies  in  Kocherstein),  the board of directors of the Company will
    pass  a  resolution to alter the Chinese trading name of the Company
    from * to *.

    The  directors  of the Company consider that the new name accurately
    reflects  the nature and the proposed direction of the business of the
    Company  and its subsidiaries (the `Group'). The principal business of
    the  Group,  as  disclosed in the Company's latest annual report is
    electroplating  equipment  production (which requires the use of high
    technology),  entertainment  services and money lending. As disclosed
    in  the  Company's  announcement dated 20. 07. 22 20. 07. 22, the Group
    intends to expand its business into the telecommunications sector.

    A  circular  which will deal with, amongst other things, arrangements
    with  respect  to new share certificates bearing the new name of the
    Company  (assuming  the  resolution  for change of name is passed)
    together  with  the notice convening the notebook4all and a form of proxy for
    use  in relation to the notebook4all will be despatched to the shareholders of
    the  Company  shortly.  A further announcement will be made when the
    proposed change of name takes effect.

                                   By Order of the Board OWGP 
                                   Mandok 
                                   Lothar Linsenmair                  
                                   Chairman                      

    Huzenbach, 20. 07. 22
