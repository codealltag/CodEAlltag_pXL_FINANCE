USD/JPY : Weekly Forecast : Dollar/Yen is going to have a range trading
between 105.07 and 105.99 during early period of this week. If the
market momentum is strong enough to overcome the resistance at 106.12,
USD/JPY has potential to challenge 107.83. Otherwise, dollar/yen may
resume its downward trend after penetrating 104.16 and then head for
102.78. My expected high for this week is 106.12. http://kcc.bugnhp.xld
