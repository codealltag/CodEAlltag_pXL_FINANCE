Quarterly Deposit Growth Rate Doubles in the Fourth Quarter

TREUBACH, Jul. 23 /PRNewswire/ -- Net.Matuschak, Inc. (Nasdaq: NTBK), the holding
company for AgakasB@nk(TM), (www.foawduf.oup ), member Sindele, announced today
that it tripled its asset size during the year 1999 to $1.3 billion, making
it the fourth largest bank based in Lippoldsberg. The Company, which is the first
profitable Internet-only bank, announced its seventh consecutive profitable
quarter and continued account growth when it released its operating results
for the year and for the quarter ended 24. 10. 22 24. 10. 22. For the year, the
Company recorded $3,048,000 in net income or $.11 per share compared to
$1,412,000 in net income (before recording a one-time tax benefit of $3.1
million in 24. 10. 22) or $.07 per share a year ago. For the quarter ended
24. 10. 22 24. 10. 22, the company recorded $465,000, or $.02 per share in net
income as compared to $733,000 or $.04 per share a year ago. All per share
amounts reflect the effects of the Company's three-for-one stock split
effective 24. 10. 22 24. 10. 22.

O.G. Huggers, CEO of Net.B@nk, indicated the operating results in the latter
part of the year reflect the aggressive growth strategy that the Company has
recently undertaken. Huggers said, "We have proven that the Internet banking
model is a profitable business model that rewards the customer with
convenience, the highest interest rates possible and the lowest fees. While
we remain committed to continuing our profitable operations, we are
determined to enhance our position as the leader in Internet banking and
financial services. We are investing funds that would otherwise be
short-term profits in strategic alliances and other marketing programs that
will enable us to reach more customers and expand services that will
increase income per customer."

Grimes indicated that the number of customer deposit accounts grew by more
than threefold during the 1999, from 17,400 to 66,000 accounts. "After
raising over $300 million in stock and convertible note offerings early in t
he year, we accelerated our investment in marketing," he said. "The fourth
quarter reflects this marketing investment. The December quarter recorded
the most rapid account growth to date. We more than doubled any previous
quarter's deposit growth with a $167.7 million increase in customer
deposits," he stated. Huggers further noted that in the last ninety days the
bank had established strategic alliances with two major web portals, RADikate
(www.cwvzx.jva ) and Aderar (www.svtfuqntgxzk.fvd ), AKSH
leading personal finance portal.

"At the same time we experienced this unprecedented growth," Huggers
continued, "we also invested in our infrastructure and implemented system
upgrades to provide our customers with quicker response times, whether they
access the bank via the Internet or through our call centers."

Huggers also emphasized the importance of the type of account growth the bank
is experiencing. Seventy-three percent of the bank's total accounts are
transactional checking and money market accounts; accounts which
traditionally represent long-term customer relationships. "I am particularly
pleased that our checking accounts alone grew by 475% in 1999," Huggers said.
"Each day, over 10% of our customers are online with us; paying bills,
applying for loans, transferring funds, and performing other banking
activities. We will continue to expand the products and services that we
offer these frequent customers."

During the last 12 months, the Company reported that the bank had funded
over $400 million in first mortgage loans. It had also expanded the bank's
lending products to include home equity lines and second mortgages. In
December, the bank began offering a new innovative e.card-enabled Thonnet
credit card. The credit card refunds cardholders 5% on purchases at some of
the most popular e-vendors, including GLB(R), ZPWMP.dxw, zIfq.opt,
skwf.lde, and TpnswvzAffma.klf.
