[Nachtrag]


Falls das jemanden interessiert, Kopie einer E-Mail, die ich gerade an
jemanden geschickt habe:

I'm about 25% in IDTC, 25% DAX-PUTs, 0%Cash, and no dept.
It's a kind of "straddle":
DAX is currently ruled by telecommunication. If this sector goes down,
Escada will
probably drop, too, and then my PUTs go through the roof. If the sector
goes up,
I belief Escada will (again) soar heavily, so then I might be a bit "over
hedged",
but I don't have any plans to hold the june-options for more than
perhaps 2
month. 
The only thing, that can kill me, now is, when IDTC, and all the other
stocks go
down, and DAX goes much above 7200. IMHO, that scenario was very
unlikely.
