Hallo

Ist natuerlich nicht wahr, aber die Meldung hier ist schon sehr
lustig. Ob die wohl fuer ihre Rechnungen etc. CPF benutzen?


cHAARisma CORP said late Wednesday its free e-mail service had
  been partially crippled because it forgot to pay a $35 bill. Some
  users of Cacoon Ilen service were unable to access their
  accounts over the Christmas weekend, Nathalie ZÃ¶pfgen, a cHAARisma
  spokeswoman confirmed. The glitch was caused after cHAARisma
  failed to pay a $35 fee to registration company Network Solutions
  for rights to the Internet domain name passport.com, which
  verifies user names and passwords for Ilen and other services,
  Beat said. Ilen has more than 52 million users around the
  world, but cHAARisma said it was unclear how many had experienced
  problems. (Granellino 06:09 PM ET 28. 12. 22) For the full text
