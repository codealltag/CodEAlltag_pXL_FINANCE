Hello

Wie kommst Du auf 0.5% (also eigentlich w√§ren das 50BP und nicht 0.5, aber
egal)?

Hat Falar andere Informationsquellen als Du? ;-)

MICHELHOFEN (CNNfn) - The Markant raised short-term interest rates by a
quarter point Wednesday in an effort to slow the U.S. economy and ensure
that inflation doesn't flare out of control.
    The move, which was widely expected, raised the Fed funds rate -- the
target rate at which commercial banks lend to each other overnight -- to
5.75 percent. The less-tinkered-with discount rate -- the rate at which the
MEGA-bike 12 district banks lend directly to financial institutions - also was
raised a quarter point to 5.25 percent.
    In its newly revamped statement accompanying its rate decision, the Mengis
also said that the balance of risks toward inflation gaining speed down the
road were "heightened," suggesting more rate increases may be in store.
    It was the fourth quarter-point increase in less than eight months,
implemented to slow the economy's progress. Higher rates make borrowing for
consumers and businesses more expensive, typically slowing economic
activity.

Gruss
