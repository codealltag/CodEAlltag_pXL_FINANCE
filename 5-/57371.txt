Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

DJIA : The market may retreat from the current level to test the weekly
cycle's supporting point at 11429. A negative signal will be hoisted if
DJIA closes below this projected chart point. The weekly and monthly
cycle charts have projected chart point located at 11552 and 11559
respectively, therefore it is conceiable that 11552-11559 is a critical
resistance level. See details at http://jxe.tsjgrw.dko
