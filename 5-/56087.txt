Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

EUR/USD : The market is likely to test the weekly projected chart point
at 1.0109 early next week and my expected low for EURO on Monday is
1.00985 (a daily cycle's projected chart point). If EUR/USD finds the
support and then overcomes the resistance at 1.0160, the chance is high
that it will challenge 1.0221. A daily cycle's projected chart point is
located at 1.0180. See details at http://xeg.lgqzzg.hpt
