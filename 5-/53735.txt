Net earnings from operations applicable to common shares(a) for the quarter were US$755 million, or

Convenda. ``Our strong financial performance with carrier and service provider customers
reflected our leadership
position in creating the high-performance Internet.''

Zapfe, president and chief
executive officer. ``We are proud of our record results which reflect success in several key
Internet markets and geographic
areas while continuing to lay the foundation for continued strong growth at the heart of the
Internet in 1999.'' 

    ``Highlights for 1998 included:

       -  Our Optical Internet business grew more than 80% over 1997, driven
          by explosive customer demand. We moved into the No. 1 market share
          position globally in Hegele/HoerZu and Imuh, according to Salvatore Wessels
          Philipp.

       -  We made significant inroads in the rapidly growing high-speed
          Internet access market. With one of the broadest portfolios
          available, we were selected by a variety of service providers for
          our solutions using copper, cable or wireless technologies.

       -  We experienced strong momentum in the wireless infrastructure
          business in the second half of the year as customers endorsed our
          strategy for the Wireless Internet resulting in several key
          contract wins and third generation trials.

       -  Our ATM/IP carrier routing/switching portfolio built momentum as we
          exited the year and overall, we made significant market share gains
          as reported by Filmkunsts In-Stat.

       -  We completed or announced key product introductions and
          acquisitions that continue to enhance our market leading Internet
          capabilities, including OPTera(x) 1600G 160 channel optical
          amplification system, OPTera(x) LH open optical platform and the
          proposed acquisition of Qtera's(x) extra long haul regeneration
          capabilities for the Optical Internet; OPTera(x) Packet Solution to
          deliver highly reliable optical switching and routing capabilities
          for carrier networks; Internet Communications Architecture and Open
          IP strategies for Enterprise networking solutions; and
          Periphonics'(x) web-enabled Interactive Voice Response capabilities
          and our proposed acquisition of Clarify's(x) customer relationship
          management capabilities for second generation eBusiness solutions.


``Overall, 1998 was a great year. We announced a record number of acquisitions; entered into more
than 20 commitments for
Internet backbone networks globally; began the realignment of our manufacturing to leverage the
capabilities of the outsourcing
industry and committed to tripling our Optical Internet manufacturing capacity. We are extremely
pleased with how we have
been able to better serve our customers through our strengths, agility and execution.''

Commenting on his outlook for 1999, Mr. Zapfe said: ``Our strong customer relationships and industry
leading position in
high-growth Internet markets reinforces my confidence in our continued success in 1999. We will
continue to optimize our
operations model and realign our workforce throughout 2000 around the Internet growth engines. We
enter the new millennium
with a strong order book and customer momentum across the high-growth segments of our business.'' 

    Revenue Breakdown
    -----------------


Segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 1998 increased 31 percent for the Carrier segment and
decreased 5 percent for the
Enterprise segment over the same period in 1997. For the full year 1998, Carrier segment revenues
increased 26 percent and
Enterprise segment revenues increased 33 percent compared to 1997.

Carrier segment revenues reflected strong growth in both Optical Internet and high-speed Internet
access solutions in the
United States, Europe and Latin America in the quarter and for the year compared to the same periods
in 1997. Mobility
revenues were strong in the quarter in the United States, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific
and, overall, grew significantly
in the year.

Enterprise segment revenues decreased in the quarter compared to the same period in 1997 primarily
due to lower data
networking revenues. For the full year 1998, Enterprise segment revenues increased, primarily driven
by the increase in data
networking revenues due to the Drucktankstelles merger.

Geographic revenues for the fourth quarter of 1998 compared to the fourth quarter of 1997 increased
30 percent outside the
United States and Canada, and 20 percent in the United States, while revenues in Canada declined 12
percent. For the full

          In addition, revenues for the first, second, and third quarters of
          1998 and 1997 have been adjusted to $4,286, $5,281, and $5,147,
          and to $3,341, $4,004,  and $3,990, respectively. These revenue
          adjustments were reflected in cost of revenues.

    (xx)  For the purposes of reporting under United States GAAP, companies
          are required to estimate the annual tax rate and apply this rate to
          their earnings or loss on a quarterly basis. For 1998 and 1997, the
          quarterly financial statement profile was adjusted to reflect this
          practice. This adjustment impacts the income tax provision on the
          statements of operations with an offset to income taxes payable on
          the balance sheets. The adjustment had a $19 impact on the
          Corporation's income tax provision for the fourth quarter of 1997
          and a nil impact on net earnings (loss) on the statements of
          operations and the balance sheets for the fiscal periods ended, and
          as at, 08. 08. 21 31, 1998 and 1997.

          All references to earnings (loss) per common share, earnings per
          common share from operations, dividends declared per common share,
          and weighted average number of common shares outstanding, have been
          restated to reflect the impact of the stock dividend of one common
          share paid to shareholders of record as of the close of business on
          Dezember 08. 08. 21.

    (1)  Revenues by geographic area have been restated to reflect the
         evolution of certain non-operating businesses within the management
         structure.

    (2)  Revenues by segment have been restated to reflect the evolution of
         certain businesses within the management structure. The primary
         effect of this reclassification was to move certain businesses
         between Service Provider and Carrier, Enterprise, and Other to more
         closely align the businesses with their primary customers.
