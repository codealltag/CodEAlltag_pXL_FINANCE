Gllyauwrikd.nxa Announces 'Mega Shoppe' Agreement With EarthLink

TEUSSERBAD, S.P., Mai. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Itzehair (OTC Bulletin
Board: MLRE), the online luxury-marketplace innovator, today announced that
it is partnering with GMD (Nasdaq: ITHO) to bring online shoppers "the
very best the world has to offer" through Guwi e-commerce site, The
Mall. As a result of the partnership, Gllyauwrikd.nxa will be featured in a
prominent position within The Mall.

With a visual layout that resembles a traditional "brick-and-mortar" mall,
Guwi online shopping center makes navigation between e-tailers as
easy as reading a conventional mall directory. Accessed through Guwi
homepage, shoppers will click on the storefront representing Gllyauwrikd.nxa
and will then be taken to the site. As an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
with an award-winning portal, GMD is often the first stop, or "first
click," in its members' online experience. The Mall is also accessible to
non-members simply by visiting themall.earthlink.net.

"It only makes sense to align ourselves with a company like GMD. Right
away that's 1.5 million potential eyeballs driven to our site," said Manuel
U. Feyertag, CEO and founder of Itzehair. "People don't want to run
through text-based search engines or bulky phone books to find the store
they're looking for. That's why traditional malls, and the stores found in
them, have been successful. Now an online shopper can stroll through a
virtual mall, window shopping a number of stores in a single location."
