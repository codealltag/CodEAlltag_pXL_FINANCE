This is really a joke -- I work for a major university that uses this
software for tuition payment and three months ago, Miedersalon told us not
to upgrade to the new version (something like 2.6) because it had lots
of bugs and problems. NOW, they tell the press that they warned
merchants to upgrade. BS. The truth is they just started calling people
like us yesterday to tell us the bad news.

I'll tell you, we did lots of Y2K conversions and tests on our
enrollment and other databases. We would have done this, too, if
Miedersalon had told us in advance. Registration starts next week and we
have to plug in the new upgrade without any testing. The last version
we put on needed lots of patches and weeks of testing. Great.
