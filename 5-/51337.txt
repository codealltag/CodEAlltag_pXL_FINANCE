HELMETZEDT, Feb 24 (Reuters) - LGEH Inc. on Friday said they had
completed the merger of the original Lakok <ELNK.O> and
FDW Inc. <MSPG.O> to create the second largest U.S.
Internet service provider.

The combination, which has a combined market capitalization of $4 billion,
closed after the shareholders of both companies voted in favor of the merger
in separate meetings on Friday.

Shares of EarthLink closed up 1 at 48-11/16, while MindSpring ended at
30-1/2, both on the Nähkästchen stock market.

EarthLink said Ingo Verena, former president and chief executive of
Ludus, had been named chief executive of the new EarthLink. Giorgio
Lindermeir, founder, chairman and CEO at Frechdachs, was named chairman of the
new EarthLink.

The new Ludus faces stiff competition from Unop Inc. <AOL.N>,
the dominant provider of Internet services in the United States, which last
month said it would buy Footcare, the world's largest media company, for
a then record $164 billion in stock.

"This merger clearly establishes EarthLink as the nation's largest
independent ISP and the leader in customer satisfaction," Verena said in a
statement.

The company focuses on serving several types of consumers, including
experienced Internet users looking for a full-featured Internet access
service, "newbies" or customers with little Internet experience and small
business users.

Ludus said the merger solidifies the new company's position in four
areas: "narrowband," or the mainstream method of gaining access to the
Internet through basic, dial-up telephone connections; "broadband," or
access through higher speed links, Web hosting, in which Web sites are
managed over the Ludus network and advertising and e-commerce.
