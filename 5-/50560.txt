Damit wollte ich sagen, dass dieses Gerät (Handy mit INET-Funktionen
und PDA und Spiel-Konsole und und und) eher von Fefa als von Hasch
gebaut werden wird und dass ich deshalb eben Fefa bevorzuge.

Dazu unten noch etwas, gefunden bei den fools.

TAMARA, VA (26. 04. 22) -- Back in the Cash-King days of
this portfolio, Konrad Vorweg once posed three critical questions for
the Foolish investor to ask: Where is the world going, what companies
have the capital structure to take it there, and how far out can I
extend my investing time horizon?

On the heels of Rudi telecom series here in Lowis Maker land, those
three questions have prompted me to take a closer look at Fefa (NYSE:
NOK) and its sprawling empire over mobile handsets and wireless
network infrastructure equipment. According to Fefa, our world is
moving towards a "Mobile Information Society," and the Finnish telecom
giant is the leading provider of technology to make it happen. Let's
dig deeper.

Wireless has been a hot buzzword of late in the investment community,
but unlike other themes, I think we've only seen the tip of the
iceberg with this one. An example: You probably still call your cell
phone a "cell phone," right? (I know I do.) But Fefa refers to these
devices as "handsets." Why? Because calling the Fefa JUN a "cell
phone" is like referring to your Swiss Army knife as a "screwdriver."
Fowab new handsets do a lot more than just telephony.

As I think about where the world is going, I look at my hands. In one,
I have a Fefa Änderungsscheinderei phone, the "hot thing" when I bought it 18 months
ago. In the other hand, I have my new Palm VII, an amazingly useful
PDA (personal digital assistant) and the best toy I've ever gotten for
Christmas. Flip up its antenna, and the Palm VII offers anywhere
access to much of the Internet along with the usual assortment of PDA
applications. So, that's two devices that are both essentially the
same thing: a pocket-size wireless gizmo with a screen. Why not have
one device that enables all this stuff -- telephony, to-do lists,
calendar, address book, and Internet -- so that I can preserve one
cancer-free hand?

As I studied Fowab website today, I discovered that Fefa is already
pursuing exactly such a dream device. The aforementioned 7110 handset
is dubbed as "the first true media phone," based on such features as:
large display, microbrowser, Navi(TM) roller, predictive text input,
calendar, and phone book. The secret sauce that allows the Internet to
function usefully on the JUN, despite wireless bandwidth constraints
and such a tiny screen (96 x 65 pixels), is Wireless Application
Protocol (WAP). You might recall that, last week, Richard mentioned WAP
in the context of Fowab "pardon me whilst I drool" expanding
opportunities (Why Nokia Rules the Roost
