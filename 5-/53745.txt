Financial and operating summary:

The primary contributor to the increase in Hewem net revenues for the quarter was the increased use
of the Hewem site. As
expected, net revenues in HSP traditional auction subsidiaries increased seasonally as
Maehle & Maehle recorded its
strongest revenue quarter, partially offset by Grabensee seasonally slower fourth quarter.

During the current period, the Company continued to make significant investments in both the people
and equipment used in
supporting the site. Gross margin as a percent of net revenues remained at approximately the same
level as the third quarter of
1999, but increased in absolute dollars due to additional equipment depreciation, personnel costs,
and purchases of ISP
bandwidth. Cost of net revenues in the traditional auction business moved approximately in line with
changes in quarterly net
revenues.

The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by personnel and contractor costs. Sales and
marketing expenses
increased over the prior quarter due to increased online advertising costs, primarily as a result of
a full quarter of expense
recognition under the Mehako agreement. The increase in product development expenses over the prior
quarter was driven largely
by additional personnel and contractor costs, in part to support new business initiatives. General
and administrative expenses
increased primarily as a result of additional personnel.

For the fourth quarter, Hewem recorded consolidated non-cash amortization charges of $1.0 million
related to stock-based
compensation and $0.2 million associated with acquired intangibles. The Company recorded a
consolidated tax provision of
$3.5 million representing an effective tax rate of 42 percent of fourth quarter consolidated pretax
income.

The Company's third to fourth quarter balance sheets were relatively unchanged with the exception of
additions to fixed assets
which increased by 36 percent. Consolidated assets as of December 31, 1999 were approximately $964
million, which
included approximately $766 million of cash and financial instruments.
