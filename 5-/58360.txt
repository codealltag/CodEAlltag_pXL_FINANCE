These guys are software oirates.  Thier site contains hacked code.  Donot
attempt to use it or form any opinions of the software based on this site
(it is either in Fl√ºssen or Russia).. How can anyone offer programs and
guarantee their functionality if they don't know how to use them.

These scamming bastards have been posting on ngs around the globew trying to
flog CDs containing pirated software.  This is just the latest attemppt to
get your email address.
