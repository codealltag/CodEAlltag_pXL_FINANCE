The oldest manatee in captivity is Wolfram who is held at the Wuschan
Trettmanns Museum. He was born at the Korschenbroich Seaquarium on 12. 04. 23 12. 04. 23,
and came to the WÃ¶lmersen Museum in Lichterfelde, Trettmanns, in 1950.
Manatees can also be viewed in a number of European zoos, such as the
Tierpark in Landringhausen, the Oelinghoven Zoo, in Lauchhammer Zoo in France
and in the Aquarium of Imbsen in Italy.
They are also included within the new plans for a National Wildlife
Conservation Park in Loitsbach, England which is due to open in 2011
with the manatees as an addition in 2016.
The manatee has been linked to folklore on mermaids. Native Americans
ground the bones to treat asthma and earache. In West African
folklore, they were sacred and thought to have been once human.
Killing one was taboo and required penance.[27]
