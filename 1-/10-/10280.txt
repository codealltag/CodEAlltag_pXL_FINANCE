Roulette  Turnaround System
Author Obersten
First, a glossary of Turnaround terms.-
This one comes from a PROFFESIONAL, and i haven't tested it myself.
(lack of time)

A "Series" is a sequence of bets, usually one in which the player is
in the hole and working towards a profit. You'll hear the term
"recovery series" from time to time, and it tells you that every
losing series is assumed to be reversible. There's also an animal
called a "winning series": more about that later. Don't worry about
losing series: Turnaround will run out of money once in a while if you
impose a sensible stop loss limit, but it won't happen often.
The "LTD" is a pair of figures you will need to keep in your head at
all times. If you can't handle simple mental arithmetic, this method
is not for you. If you are a blackjack player who counts cards, relief
is at hand -- Turnaround is a whole lot easier and more effective than
counting and is virtually undetectable by pit cops. "LTD" is short for
loss-to-date, and the first figure in the pair tells you how many
chips you're currently down according to the special tracking method
the system uses. The second figure indicates the correct next bet
(NB); basically, your NB stays the same after a loss and increases
according to a fixed formula after a win.
The "Steal" is a process by which the final profit when a recovery
series is resolved is deliberately inflated. When you win, say, 3
units you steal one unit before deducting the win from the LTD and
calculating the value of the next bet (NB). Example: -1, -1, -1, -1,
-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, +1, +3, +4, -5, -5, -5, +5, +6, +7, +5. The LTD
after the win that ended a streak of 9 losses was "9,3" because the
single unit won was not deducted from the loss-to-date. The NB jumped
from 1 to 3 units for reasons I will explain in a moment. The LTD for
the series changed as follows: -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, +1
(9,3), +3 (7,4), +4 (4,5), -5 (9,5), -5 (14,5), -5 (19,5), +5 (15,6),
+6 (10,7), +7 (4,5), +5 (EOS = end of series).


JUMPING AND PUMPING

The "Jump" uses the first figure in the LTD to set the value of the
NB.  My recommendation is that you do not divide the LTD by less than
6 to get the revised NB, meaning that a seven-bet win streak will end
the recovery series.
Don't misunderstand the thinking here: I am not saying that seven-bet
hot streaks are frequent or even necessary to Turnaround's success.
But I am saying that your next bet must always be guided by full
knowledge of how much you must win in order to turn a recovery series
around and come out with a profit.
The "Pump" is another device to maintain the value of the NB at a
level that makes recovery attainable. Fabio "plus one after a win"
rule is pathetically inadequate: it won't get you where you need to go
unless the dealer is having a very bad day. When the game starts going
your way, you must press as hard as you can, keeping in mind that if
you overdo it, a reversal will do you very serious harm.
The Pump percentage I use is 20 percent, meaning that after the first
win in a potential hot streak, you multiply the previous bet by 1.2 to
get the NB. The first win after a losing streak (the previous bet when
you're trying to figure the Pump) was set by the Jump, and now it's
time to press a little harder.
Here's a sample sequence with the Steal, the Jump and the Pump all in
play: (49,8) -8, -8, -8, +8 (66,11), +11, +13, -16 (60,16), -16, +16
(61,19), +19, +23 (21,22). In this sequence there were 5 losses and 6
wins, but to get you to the opening LTD of 49,8 the house advantage
must have been running high beforehand. Generally, you should expect
to lose more bets than you win (the casino depends on that). The trick
is to make sure that you "win more when you win than you lose when you
lose," and that's what Turnaround is all about. In this example, the 5
losses averaged -11 units, and the six wins averaged +15. That's a
good thing! Note that when the first figure in the LTD dropped to 21,
the NB became 22 and not 23 x 1.2 (28), applying a rule that the NB
after a win can never be less than the LTD divided by 6 or more than
the LTD+1 unit. More about that in a moment.
Next: "Halving." This is exactly what it sounds like: at a certain
point in a losing streak, Turnaround requires you to reduce further
potential losses by cutting your bet down the middle. Again, balance
is important here -- do it too soon or too often, and your bet will
bounce up and down like a yo-yo gone wild, punching you further into
the hole with each downturn.
The Halving rule limits the ploy to bets in double figures and
requires you to hold off until you have lost two "whole" bets in a row
or, in blackjack, have seen a double or split raked into the dealer's
tray. What you're trying to avoid is the damage from a "volley" --
(60,10), -10 (70,5), +5 (66,11), -11 (77,6), +6 (72,12), -12 (84,6),
+6 (79,13), and so on -- and since paired losses are about half as
frequent as isolated ones -- the "two lost bets" rule works well.
If you can get away with it, keep halving until the NB gets down to
single digits, remembering that the lower you go, the bigger will be
the Jump when you finally win a bet and have to recalculate the NB as
LTD/6. Here's another example: (169,58), -58, -58, -29, -15, -8, +8
(330,55). It's quite a jump from 8 units to 55 -- more than a parlay,
that's for sure -- and in blackjack particularly, you should limit
yourself to no more than two bet reductions if the pit cops are "on
heat."


THE DUMP


The final Turnaround oddity is the "Dump." Translation: run for the
hills. This is a concession to the tendency we all have to beat a safe
retreat when a dealer gets hot or our "luck" runs cold. Computer
simulations presume that a player will stick it out through thick and
thin, betting bravely onward regardless of repeated punishment and
waiting patiently for a negative trend to reverse itself. Human beings
just don't play that way.
 Take a walk if the house gets, say, 10 bets ahead.
I'd rather not apply the Dump at all, but human nature -- mine, at
least -- doesn't permit me to bet on and on like a senseless robot
when I'm getting my butt kicked. So, it makes sense to regulate the
bail-out process. A guiding principle of Turnaround is to provide a
rule to cover every situation that could possibly arise in a game of
chance, relieving the player of the agonies of indecision. OK, that
makes me a robot after all, but not a senseless one, since all of the
system rules are based upon logic and common sense.
When Turnaround made its debut on the Internet in 22. 02. 22 1997,
several math-mad computer mavens leaped forward to offer to write
source code for simulations which would prove that this particular
method of progressive betting is no better than any other. After
months of to-ing and fro-ing, caused by the inability of all these
experts to apply the Turnaround rules correctly, the most persistent
among them pronounced that my method had an expected win rate of over
99.5 percent or about the same as a Small Martingale.
Secondly, the Martingale or double-up method is doomed as soon as it
hits a losing streak of a dozen bets or more, whereas Turnaround
freezes the bet in response to a loss and requires it to be repeatedly
halved after a certain point. So, a Martingale bettor trying to win at
a casino with a 3,000-unit house limit will run out of options once a
dozen consecutive losses require that his next bet be 4,096 units.
He's 4,095 units "in the hole" and the math guys say that if he
reduces his next bet to 3,000 units and wins, then he's still in
trouble.

THE Turnaround RULES

Here are the system rules, step by step:-

1. Bet the minimum (your own or the table minimum) on the first
decision in a series. I recommend $5 units to start with, meaning that
if the table minimum is $25, your first bet is 5 units and will go up
or down in increments of $5. Don't be tempted to use a table minimum
above $5 as your increment (raising your bet from $25 to $50 to $75
and so on at a $25 table).

2. WIN, bet MIN+1, and be ready to follow the Turnaround win
progression: (+1), 2, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37 etc. LOSE, bet the
same amount. At a $25 table, the progression will be (+5), 6, 6, 8,
11, 15, 20, 26, 33, 41 etc. When the win progression ends, set the
next bet (NB) at 2 units, except when a split/double increases the
loss to more than the initial bet, in which case freeze the NB at that
point.
EXAMPLE: +1, +2, +2, +4, +7, +11, -16, +2.
EXAMPLE: +1, +2, +2, +4, +7, +11, -32, +16.

3. Any win after a succession of losses invokes the Steal principle,
whereby a single chip is deducted from the win before the loss to date
(LTD) is revised.

4. The LTD consists of two figures, best expressed as "n1,n2." The
first figure, n1, is the amount DOWN at any point, and is inflated by
the Steal; n2 is the amount OUT -- meaning the value of the next bet
(NB) "out" on the table. Think of the LTD as "Down comma Out" and the
mental chore of revising it after each outcome will quickly become
second nature.
EXAMPLE: -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, +1 (7 DOWN, 2 OUT), +2 (6,3), -3,
-3, +3 (10,4), +4 (7,5), +5 (3,4), -4, -4, +4 (8,5), +5 (4,5), +5 (EOS
= end of series). HA 16% but TA wins 8 units = 16% of Action of 50u.

5. A win after one or more losses also invokes the Jump, whereby NB is
calculated by dividing n1 (the inflated loss to date) by a
predetermined amount. I recommend that if n1 is 20 or less, NB = n1/4;
if n1 is more than (>) 20 and less than (<) 51, NB = n1/5; if n1 > 50,
NB = n1/6.

6. After a win, NB must never be LESS than the first figure in the LTD
(n1) divided by 6 or MORE than n1+1. If EOS is achieved, NB always
falls back to the minimum.

7. After a win to which the Jump has been applied, use the Pump to
press the NB further. This increase should be 20 percent, rounded,
meaning that it has no effect until the previous bet (PB) hits 8 units
(8 x 1.2 = 9.6 = 10).
EXAMPLE: (99,17), -17, -17, -17, +17 (134,23), +23, +28, -34 (119,34),
+34 (86,41), +41 (46,47), +47 = EOS. NOTE that 41 x 1.2 = 49.2 = 49
but the final Turnaround bet was reduced to 47 that your next bet (NB)
must never exceed DOWN+1.

8. Use Halving to limit potential losses as soon as you lose two
successive bets of 10 units or more, and keep Halving until NB reaches
single digits. In blackjack, start Halving if a double/split (two or
more hands, in effect) costs you 20u or more. Blackjack players
conscious of dealer/pit scrutiny should not use Halving more than
twice in any sequence.
EXAMPLE: (99,17), -17, -17, -9, +9 (134,23), -23, -23, -12, -6, +6
(192,32), -32, -32, -16, -8, -8, +8 (271,46), +46, +55, +66, +79
(28,29), +29 = EOS.

9. Halving does NOT apply if a win progression ends with a lost double/
split but takes effect if another double-digit loss is suffered.
EXAMPLE: +1, +2, +2, +4, +7, +11, -32 (17,16), -16, -8, +8 (34,10),
+10, +12 (14,14), +15.

10. If, as above, raising the NB to match DOWN+1 will increase it by
not more than 10 percent, make the adjustment in the hope that Fön-X
will be achieved. Otherwise, a series will be extended for an extra
one or two bets, which is contrary to our objective: wrapping up a
recovery series in as few bets as possible before reverting to a
minimum bet and starting a new series. In our example above, a win at
14,14 would have given us an LTD of 1,2 because of the Steal.

11. Use the Dump to stop play in a damaging location, transferring the
LTD in full to a new deck, shoe or table whenever it's convenient.
Experienced gamblers know that trends exist, and that a persistent
downturn will sometimes seem unbeatable. The basic rule is to quit
playing and move as soon as the second of two successive losses takes
the LTD above 100 units, then 200, then 500, 1000, 2000 and so on.
Don't Dump if Halving has already begun, or within five bets of the
last move. An alternative is to track wins and losses and Dump as soon
as the house gets, say, 10 bets ahead of you in any series (for
instance, if the house has taken 16 bets vs. your 6). The advantage of
this method is that it's more consistent than the original variable
trigger approach.


12. In blackjack, play strictly according to basic strategy. There are
about as many variations on the BPS (basic playing strategy) as there
are "experts" on the game, but if you stick strictly to whichever book
you choose, you will reduce the house edge to substantially less than
1 percent. Here's the BPS I recommend...

"experts" (usually card counters) recommend standing with 7,7
against 10 and standing with 16 against A but it's a bad idea;
never, ever, take insurance or even money (which is the same
thing); there's a case to be made for doubling A,8 or A,9
against 4-6, but it's a very aggressive play.

"CUSTOMIZING" Turnaround
Many of the rules of Turnaround can be adapted to suit the style of
the individual player. For example, since the Steal drives the
required bet rapidly upward in a downturn, you might feel that once it
has been applied often enough to guarantee a reasonable win when Fön-X
is eventually achieved, it should be abandoned after a certain point.
Let's say you decide to ditch the Steal once the LTD hits 50. Here's
how a tough sequence of bets might look: -1, -1, -1, +1 (3,2), -2, -2,
-2, -2, -2, -2, -2, +2 (16,4), -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, +4
(49,9), -9, -9, -9, -9, -9, +9 (86,15), +15 (72,18), +18 (55,22), +22
(34,26), -26, -26, -13, +7 (93,16), +16 (78,19), +19 (60,23), +23
(38,28), +28 (11,12), +12 (Fön-X). Here, the house won 27 bets out of
40, but Turnaround bested an HA of 14/40 = 35% by exploiting upturns
and backing off during downturns, overcoming the fact that losing
streaks were longer and more frequent than winning ones. The 27 losses
cost the player a total of 163 units for an ALB (average losing bet)
of 6 units. The 13 winning bets recouped 178 units for an AWB of 14
units, kicking the HA all the way back to breakfast-time and making a
profit of 15 units against horrendous odds.
If we "replay" those same hands with the Steal abandoned about half
way through, the sequence looks like this: -1, -1, -1, +1 (3,2), -2,
-2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, +2 (16,4), -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, -4, -4,
+4 (49,9), -9, -9, -9, -9, -9, +9 (85,15), +15 (70,18), +18 (52,22),
+22 (30,26), -26, -26, -13, +7 (88,16), +16 (72,19), +19 (53,23), +23
(30,28), +28 (2,3), +3 (Fön-X). The effect in this case was simply to
reduce the "Turnaround bet" -- the last bet needed to end a recovery
series with a profit -- from 12 units to 3 units. Since the critical
bet was a winner, that was a bad thing, but if it had lost, the next
bet (NB) would also have been much smaller, thus confronting the
player with a greatly reduced exposure.
The recommended levels for the Steal (-1), the Jump (LTD/4,5,6) and
the Pump (PB x 1.2) could all be said to be "aggressive," and a
cautious player could limit his exposure while still following the
Turnaround rules and principles. Keep in mind that the more timid the
play, the longer it will sometimes take to exploit an upward trend and
end a series with a profit before falling back to a minimum bet. When
we reduced the Steal above, we cut the Fön-X win from 15 units to 6 -- a
high price which a conservative player might consider worth every
penny. Note that in the first version of the sequence (the recommended
approach) Turnaround won 15 units on action of 341 units, achieving a
player "hold" of 4.4 percent. A 1-chip flat bettor would have lost 14
units on total action of 40 units, giving the house a "hold" of 35
percent. If you play Turnaround for long enough, even if all you're
willing to do is try it out at home, you will learn that making money
from sequences of bets in which the house had the clear edge is
commonplace.
The concept of "stealing" one unit before figuring out the loss to
date and the related next bet is unique to Turnaround in spite of the
fact that reward proportionate to risk is as reasonable and sensible a
goal in gambling as it is in any other money-making endeavor.
In contrast, Turnaround applies the requirement that the longer a
recovery sequence (or series) lasts, the greater should be the final
profit. I have experimented with applying the Steal to lost bets as
well as winning ones, and naturally the end result is always an even
greater profit; the downside is that when wins are few and far
between, the strain on the bankroll is greatly increased.
For example, consider a TA sequence which plays out like the one used
at the very beginning of this article: -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,
-1, +1 (9,3), +3 (7,4), +4 (4,5), -5 (9,5), -5 (14,5), -5 (19,5), +5
(15,6), +6 (10,7), +7 (4,5), +5 (EOS = end of series). With the Steal
applied to all bets, win or lose, the same sequence would be as
follows: -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, +1 (18,3), +3 (16,4), +4
(13,5), -5 (19,5), -5 (25,5), -5 (31,5), +5 (27,6), +6 (22,7), +7
(16,8), +8 (9,10).
Stealing after wins only earned us a profit of 7 units and delivered a
resolution after a series in which the house won 12 bets and we won 7
bets. The more aggressive approach gave us a profit of 10 units but
left us in need of another win to achieve Turnaround. The effect of
applying an all-around Steal, then, is to win more chips after facing
greater risks. Either way, you can be confident that Turnaround will
consistently hand you a profit after you have lost more bets than you
won.

THE RED/BLACK TEST OF Turnaround

If you're among the doubters, try this little test: take the K and Q
of hearts out of a single deck, creating a stack of 50 cards in which
there are 26 blacks and 24 reds and black therefore has an advantage
over red of 4 percent. Shuffle them rigorously, then turn them over
one by one, using the Turnaround method to bet that the next card will
be red. The HA will vary before each card is dealt, depending on how
many blacks and reds have preceded it, but you can realistically
expect a 4 percent house edge before the first card is turned over,
and the same house edge before the 50th card is exposed. Time and
again, you will finish the deck with Turnaround substantially in
profit in spite of a clear, absolute house advantage. The red/black
test will sometimes hit the end of the deck in the middle of the
recovery series, but then you do just as you would in a casino and
roll over the LTD to the first "hand" of the new "shoe."

Lastly, a clarification of the Dump. Walking away from a costly string
of losses is not merely an option for a real gambler (as opposed to
someone who bases his "knowledge" of casino games upon computer
simulations): it's a fact of life. Everyone does it, and everyone
should do it. It's a difficult thing to regulate because so many
influences push us to the point where we don't want to play any more
against a particular dealer or at a particular table. To name a few:
dealer hot streaks, prod-nose pit bosses, incompetent and/or
inebriated players, fatigue, boredom, hunger and a stressed-out
bladder. Proponents of computer simulations argue that their pale
imitations of casino games are mathematically accurate, but in truth
they can't be. No simulation exists which can imitate more than one or
two components of real casino play at a time, and their most critical
omission is human nature. I don't recommend changing your bet or
varying basic blackjack strategy on a whim because one of the primary
principles of Turnaround is that consistency is critical to long-term
profit. But I do encourage you to back off from a game the moment you
begin to feel uncomfortable or pessimistic: never, ever play if it
doesn't "feel right."
There's no way a computer simulation can ape a gut feeling that tells
a player when to quit, and it's difficult to devise rules to cover
that situation. Turnaround's Dump will sometimes save your bankroll
and will sometimes pull you out of the frying pan and into the fire.
The one advantage of a computer simulation is that it enables you to
test a variety of strategems against the same set of outcomes, but
even when analysis of a million plays indicates that you would have
won more without the Dump than with it, you can't say, "OK, I'll never
walk away from a game again" because uninterrupted betting is an
impossibility in real life.
I suggested earlier that one way to "Dump" is to walk away from a shoe
(or a series) if the house pulls 10 bets ahead of you, winning 15 bets
out of the first 20, for example. At -10, you won't have to move very
often, whereas at -5 you'll be abandoning non-profitable situations
pretty frequently, taking your LTD with you to another location and
resuming play per the system rules. Personally, I favor frequent moves
and "natural breaks" -- they alleviate boredom and keep me alert, and
reduce the temptation to wobble off the rails and temporarily depart
from the rules (always a no-no!). Bottom line: it's up to the player.


WRINKLES


I can't over-emphasize the wisdom of the individual player tailoring
Turnaround to meet his/her needs and circumstances, so long as the key
elements are not totally disabled. I didn't offer specific suggestions
in the original presentation on my web site because I was concerned
that the system was already quite complicated enough, and E-mail from
all over the world confirmed that assessment. Now that Turnaround is,
in effect, "retired" from the Internet, I can cover this topic in
greater detail.
Anyone who has bet against a game of chance for just a few hundred
outcomes knows that while skilled money management can beat the odds
for very long periods of time, eventual damaging streaks in favor of
the house are inevitable. Turnaround's damage control is effective but
not infallible, and absent a very large bankroll, it is sometimes wise
to help it out a little. A technique I call "Breakdown" would take an
LTD of, for example, 19,3 x $100 units and break it up into four
separate targets of 19,3 x $25 units. It will take much longer to
achieve Turnaround -- at least four times longer! -- but the strain on
the bankroll will usually be substantially reduced.
"Breakdown" assumes the use of a couple of other Turnaround concepts,
"Multi-level Betting" and "Target Betting," both of which also further
complicate the system but greatly enhance its effectiveness, and
extends the idea of the Dump (a natural break in play in response to a
downturn) into something called "Deferred Betting."
The idea of Multi-level Betting is to enhance the system's response
when the house edge is biting extra hard. Assuming a start-up at $5
units, you would apply the Dump when the LTD exceeds 100 units and
make a quick conversion to $10 or $25 units before resuming play
against a new shoe. For example, an LTD of 117,19 x $5 would become
59,10 x $10
or 24,4 x $25, the idea being that the value of incremental increases
goes up and the likelihood of achieving Turnaround is often improved
because fewer consecutive wins are needed. In essence, use of the
multi-level conversion puts a little more power behind the Pump, which
increases the next bet (NB) by 20 percent after every win until the LTD
+1 ceiling is reached. Say you're at 117,19 x $5 and you log a win,
bringing the LTD down to 99,23 and the NB to $115. At 59,10 x $10, a
win would take the LTD to 50,12 and the NB to $120, and at 24,4 x $25,
the LTD would drop to 21,5 and the NB would therefore be worth $125.
Small differences, maybe, but small differences are what Turnaround is
all about!
"Target Betting" is a sneaky profit-builder which is, in essence,
Deferred Betting without any actual prior losses. It exploits the fact
that the mathematicians are right on the money when they remind us
that the cards, dice or whatever have no memory and so are unaffected
by bets that have been won or lost to date. Usually, Turnaround starts
betting in a new series with a clean slate and the opening wager is
therefore 1 unit and the LTD is, in effect, 0,1. But what if we open
play with a fictitious LTD of, say, 19,3? If the house edge stays
reasonably close to the norm, we'll make more money when
Turnaroundachieves end of series (EOS) is what.
Here's a blackjack Target Betting example, starting out with a
spurious LTD of 19,3: -3 (22,3), +4.5 (BJ), +4, -5 (22,5), -10 (32,5),

Of course, Target Betting increases the risk that a runaway house edge
will push the Turnaround bet into what I call brown trouser territory,
and the potential exposure disqualifies it from the repertoire of a
conservative player. It's just another wrinkle in the Turnaround
technique: an example of how the system can be "customized" to suit
the personality of the person who's using it.


The absolute minimum required to beat a pendulum that refuses to swing
your way is 100 units. My greatest success has been with a 500-unit
bank, but the real objective of Turnaround is to keep building your
stash by adding to it after every winning session, splitting the take
down the middle and extracting only half of your winnings as true
profit.


Do this: test Turnaround thoroughly at your "home casino," and don't
even think of backing it with a thin dime until you have learned the
rules upside down and inside out. Without money management, the only
allies the gambler has are luck and intuition, and neither of those is
reliable. One of Turnaround's great strengths is that it is virtually
undetectable, and therefore unlikely to attract casino "heat."The bad
news is that the Martingales, the Würfl, the Laboucheres and all
the other traditional methods touted in countless gambling "text
books" are doomed to lose. The good news is that Turnaround is a
winner, for those who are willing to work at it.


We've had people complain that the rules are "too complicated" or
"impossible to learn." Baloney! We've learned them, and neither of us
doesn't pretend to be a genius. If you're looking for a simple way to
beat the casinos, get used to this simple fact: there isn't one.
