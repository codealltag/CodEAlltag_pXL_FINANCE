The quantum probability chart suggests that 344.8 is a critical point. If the
market momentum can penetrate 344.8, the next target would be 332.5 and the
critical supporting point is expected at 320.1. On the other hand if platinum
can overcome the resistance at 357.2, the market may head for 375.7 with a
resistance point located at 369.5. http://flecosn.keraor.cxn/rgzurb/ Each
quantum jump is represented by 6.2 and all projected chart points are
interrelated and is separated by a multiple of this multiple, 6.2 dollars.
This forecast is based on a mathematical model and it may or may not predict
the market movement accurately.
