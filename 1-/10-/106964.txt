The quantum frequency chart indicates that 1.6264 is a critical point and it
is very likely that the market will challenge 1.6264 early this month. If the
market momentum is strong enough to penetrate 1.6264, the critical supporting
point at 1.6001 will be challenged. On the other hand, British Pound may test
the resistance point at 1.6659 and a stronger resistance level is expected at
1.6922. http://mrr.aiksyk.onz.ks/~yiluht/ozi.kitd Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0132 point and all projected chart points are interrelated
and is separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0132 point. This forecast
is based on a mathematical model and it may or may not predict the market
movement accurately.
