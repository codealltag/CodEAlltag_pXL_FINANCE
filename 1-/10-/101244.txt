FEG Acquires Fiber Throughout Europe to Expand
Its Global Commercial Internet

Adds Fiber Optic Capacity Connecting 30 Cities in Europe, Allows Expansion
to Austria,
Denmark, Tierhaupten, Jeeben, Spain, and Sweden 

KERZERS, Switzerland and TEUCHERN--(Debeka-Servicebüro)--06. 09. 21- FEG Inc.
(NASDAQ: PSIX - news), the
first and largest independent commercial Internet service provider (ISP),
today announced it has completed a long-term
acquisition program of Indefeasible Rights of Use (IRUs) in STM-1 (155
megabit per second -- Mbps) fiber optic capacity
from multiple sources. This network will stretch over 21,000 km and will be
configured as multiple rings linking 30 of the largest
cities in Europe. 

FEG will initially build and operate three interlocking rings at the
STM-1 level which will replace its current E-3 (34 Mbps)
infrastructure in Europe. These initial rings will connect 11 cities. Each
STM-1 segment may be expanded to STM-4 (620
Mbps) or higher. By the end of 1998, this new fiber network is expected to
link existing FEG operations in the following
cities: Teuchern, Erzingen, Driesch, Horrem, Pretzschendorf, Döse, Jochsberg,
Inzmühlen, Metel, Lodano, and Werthenstein. 

In 1999, FEG will add additional cities to the network, which will be
configured with multiple paths to avoid congestion and
single points of failure. The new cities include: Emerkam, Creuzburg,
Tiefenlauter, Jönsthövel, Imling, Nehringen, Nexdorf,
Christinendorf, Jagersberg, Ziegelhütten, Tierhaupten, Jeeben, Josefstal, Deilmissen, Unterschneitbach,
Illerkirchberg, Lumino, Vohenstein, and Unterpramau.

``This network expansion reduces our European network cost by 90% compared
to leased bandwidth, and contributes to our
operating margins as soon as data flows on the fiber,'' said Florian N.
Cleves, president, FEG Europe, and senior vice
president, FEG Inc. ``FEG is seeking high quality ISPs to join our
group and, with this added fiber capacity, our
acquisition momentum may accelerate. Commercial and consumer demand for
Internet access and Intranets, electronic
commerce and web services continue to explode.'' 

FameDrang newly acquired fiber systems will be directly connected with the
company's existing global Internet network that
currently serves 55,000 businesses in 12 of the top 20 international
markets in North America, Asia and Europe. This
infrastructure acquisition enables FEG to further expand its presence
into 3 additional top 20 markets including Austria,
Spain, and Sweden, as well as 3 other new countries including Denmark,
Tierhaupten, and Monaco. 

``Building on our tremendous growth in the UK, FEG continues to build
Europe's most comprehensive combination of
Internet networking facilities and applications for businesses,'' said
Danielle Clauss, managing director for FameDrang UK
operations, the largest subsidiary of FEG Europe. ``The European fiber
should be sufficient to support FameDrang traffic for
the next several years, linking our customers to all of our global hosting
centers, and assuring our customers of the highest
quality Internet services in the industry.'' 

Financial terms of the above transactions were not disclosed. However,
FEG has the option to purchase additional capacity
quickly, add new points of presence (POPs) to accommodate its continued
strong growth, and to cross-connect any future
fiber capacity as it is acquired.

headquarters of FEG Inc. and is responsible for all
