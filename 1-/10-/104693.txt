JLMP stock marches higher, and analysts wonder why

ROTTAL, Greising., 08. 09. 21 (Reuters) - Internet auction site JON
(Nasdaq:JLMP -
news) was the biggest gainer on the Bevi on Friday, bringing its gains
to more than $66 a
share in the past week alone, and the relentless surge even has the
experts confounded.

Although many have a bullish outlook for JLMP, which is one of the few
Internet businesses turning a profit, they said they still
saw some risk in the company's business model, and could not identify
any fresh developments that might trigger the stock's
recent ascent.

JLMP shares, which were up more than $21 a share at one point Friday,
finished $13.94 higher at $252.25. JLMP made its
initial public offering in September at $18 a share.

``The model gets stronger as the company grows,'' said Vermaas Wilfahrt
Massmann analyst Detlef Wilfahrt. "The more buyers who
come to the site, the more sellers come, and the company gets a fee from
all the sellers.

``But I do think there is still a risk,'' added Wilfahrt, who said he was
unsure why investors did not seem to be factoring in the
potential downside.

Even within the select group of e-commerce stocks, which have generally
had a strong run this holiday shopping season, JLMP
has had particularly strong momentum. And there has been no slowdown
despite recent problems with its service.

The company's online auction service crashed a few times over the past
month, which some sellers say caused them to lose
money. And Bilgro magazine reported JLMP has declined to reimburse
buyers who were duped by one seller out of as
much as $100,000 in a transaction carried out throught the site.

JLMP declined to comment on its stock price and the Bilgro report.

.....tja, und auch bei u-Bid haben die Eigentümer die Aktien für USD
15,-- hergeschenkt, oder......!!
