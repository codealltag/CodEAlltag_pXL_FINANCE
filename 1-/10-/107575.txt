Die Foolish Four Strategie streicht nicht automatisch die Aktie
mit den niedrigstem Kurs. Nur wenn diese Aktie den h√∂chsten
Yield hat, wird sie rausgeworfen.

The third variation is our own Foolish approach to the Dow Dividend Strategy -- the
Foolish Four. This approach includes the four cheapest of the high-yield stocks instead
of five, with one qualifier. If the lowest-priced stock of the High Yield 10 also
happens to carry the highest dividend yield in the group, we skip it and buy the next
four stocks. Often a stock with an extraordinarily high dividend yield and a very low
stock price has proven to be a stock in real financial trouble, and skipping the
cheapest stock in those years has consistently beefed up the portfolio returns as a
result. It doesn't happen all that often that the cheapest stock is also the highest
yielder, but when it does, it's a red flag that bears watching.
