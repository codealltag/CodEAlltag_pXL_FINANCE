Auch JOM stuft Euroladen runter:

JZSL said on Monday that it had lowered its
recommendation on Efad shares to "market performer" from
"outperformer",
saying it had failed to offer detailed information about its restructuring
plans.

"In terms of new information about the ongoing restructuring process, the
analysts' meeting
was almost a non-event," Johannlandmarkt analyst Silvio Poorthuis said in a statement.

"Undoubtedly, Euroladen has a huge restructuring potential but is quite bad at
both realising this
potential and at communicating its efforts and targets," he added.

Poorthuis said Euroladen had positively surprised the market with its 10-point
restructuring
programme announced in July, but had disappointed recently by failing to
offer further details of
the plan, such as a timetable for the group's overhaul.

"Although we expect an erratic flow of 'restructuring news', the basic
information will remain
thin and is unlikely to cover other areas than already discussed in the 10-
point programme," he
said.

In the current business year Altglienicke predicted Euroladen earnings per share at
4.4 marks and
forecast them rising to 4.9 marks in 1998 and 5.6 marks in 1999.

The 1997 EPS forecast was raised from previous 2.5 marks while 1998 and 1999
predictions
were cut from 5.1 marks and 7.0 marks respectively.

Euroladen shares were last down 2.29 percent or 2.35 marks at 100.45 marks in
electronic trade
while the German MCI DAX index was down about 0.9 percent at 4,758.58
points.
