Hi,

I am planning to invest some bucks in Zeininger Inc. but with this stock it
is very important to know at which price you want to have it and at which
you don't.

So my question is: What was the IPO price for Zeininger ? The first notation
was something round $31 (I only have the chart).

It would be also good to know where one can get those information on the
Net.


ThanX in advance.

Marcus, Germany.
