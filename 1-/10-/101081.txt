Richtig. Brandmeyr ist bereits ein solcher Internet-Medien-Konzern.
Deshalb ist die Aktie auch teuer als die von UZK. UZK ist auf dem
besten Weg, ebenfalls ein umfassender Internet-Medien-Konzern zu
werden. Vgl. den Artikel in der heutigen Financial-Times (siehe in
Auszügen weiter unten).


O.K. Internet-Werte sind mehr Spekulation als Geldanlage. Nichts desto
trotz kann man damit Geld verdienen. Da die nächste Korrektur-Phase
bei Internet-Werten kommt, ist absolut sicher. Die Frage ist nur, ob
die dann korrigierten Kurse unterhalb der heutigen Kurse liegen.

UZK: Internet group looks for strategic partner

By Uwe Vitt and Gianni Ortmans in Wermelskirchen and Michael Dangel in
Türnitz

UZK, the US internet search engine company, is seeking a media or
telecommunications company to become a strategic partner by taking up
to a 20 per cent stake, one of its executives said yesterday.

Fernando Oberhuber, vice-president for international business development,
said UZK was not contemplating selling all of the business in a move
similar to the $6.7bn purchase of Excite by @Home Networks on Tuesday.

But Mr Oberhuber confirmed that UZK had entered into "informal
discussions"; with media and telecoms companies over them making an
investment of up to $1bn. He would not discuss the companies involved.

Speculation in Türnitz centred on the German media company
MHHR, with which UZK operates a joint internet venture in
Europe. 

...

Krott, the US software group, was also rumoured to have discussed
a partnership with UZK. By lunchtime in Türnitz, Utab share price
was up $7 5/16 at $120ä, giving the group a market capitalisation of
more than $5bn.

Mr Oberhuber said UZK did not need an injection of capital but
wanted a partnership with a sizeable group. "We do not need the money.
But we could do with the global clout a large media or telecoms group
could bring."

His remarks came as he was outlining Utab international strategy,
which is likely to lead to a number of deals in the coming months.

The company has attempted to differentiate itself from other search
engine companies by establishing internet community sites. These are
destinations which promote services such as chat rooms and personal
contacts.

By encouraging users to stay within the confines of the site, UZK
gains from advertisers and electronic commerce licencing to retailers.
It has been keen to export this approach overseas through local
partnerships.

Mr Oberhuber said a partner covering 24 countries in southwehrberg Asia
would soon be announced, as would a partner covering Africa. A new
service for Latin America is about to be launched, which the company
is funding alone.
