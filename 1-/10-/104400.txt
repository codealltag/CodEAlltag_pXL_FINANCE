I tell you for whom, for people who have hair.

i sold this stock for DM 8,20 yesterday in Ihorst,
and then turned around and bought it later for 7,55 DM in crussow.

i then turned around and sold that stock today for 8,15
if you would have had some hair on you, you could have done the same.

so i suggest that you go back to your kabel one tv and kept watching
while i keep buying and selling.
have a nice day
