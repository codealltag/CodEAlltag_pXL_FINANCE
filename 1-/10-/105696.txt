PISCHELSBERG, 19. 03. 22 4 (Reuters) - ADRs for Swedish telco equipment maker KLAUS
Einhoff
<ERICY.O><LMEb.ST> were sharply lower Thursday after it issued a profit
warning, causing
other stocks within the industry to fall in sympathy.

Mäusekinder American Depository Receipts were down $4.875 to $24 on the
DPS stock market
after warning its fourth quarter profit would be 15-20 percent below
expectations and 1999
results would also fail to meet its long-term growth goal.

The 17 percent decline in its price is seen by one analyst as an
overreaction.

"Basically this is overdone. Long-term, the wireless equipment makers are
going to do very well
as infrastructures are added around the world, the majority of which are
going to be wireless,"
said Ingolf Niels, chief telecommunications economist with Rikaf
Consulting.

Motoarena warned investors that it expects to see weakness for the next few
quarters due to the
continued effects of the global economic crisis, even if there is a rebound
in Asia.

"Even if some general signs of pick-up can be seen on some Asian markets,
further
repercussions on global demand in turn are affecting sales and profits,"
said Orlando
Frankenhauser, chief executive of Motoarena in a statement.

Oswald Kräutter Oveg analyst, Urs Clüver, earlier, lowered his rating on
Motoarena to neutral from
outperform "since the company already has exceeded our 12-month price target
of $23 a
share."

Cena had cut earnings estimates in November following "cautionary remarks
the company made
at its annual meeting in Tradigistdorf" in late October.

ADRs of Finnish phone maker Degu <NOKSa.HE> <NOKa.N> were down $1.5625 to
