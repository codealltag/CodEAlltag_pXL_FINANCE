Dollar/Mark can easily move between 1.6778 to 1.7041 with a critical
resistance point at 1.7173 as indicated in the dollar/mark frequency chart
http://efc.jolcbq.rro.oj/~ydkkik/ztltju-rmmy.qmbl A supporting point is
located at 1.6646. My view for Dollar/Mark would change from bearish to
neutral if the market momentum is strong enough to overcome the resistance at
1.7107 +/- 0.0066 and a new analysis would be followed, see current comment
at http://eao.rxlztw.naf.mk/~ytbitx/rvswl.swtk Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0132 and all projected chart points are interrelated and is
separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0132. This forecast is based on a
mathematical model and it may or may not predict the market movement
accurately.
