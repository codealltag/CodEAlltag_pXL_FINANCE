strong trend backed by solid inject of funds - respect it in the short term
though it's highly speculative (please note similar turnover between Zookiosk
(ZGZ and GMD (Golfhaus))
good support now ard 9350
single-point estimate of peak is difficult to make but 10% from here should
be the limit for 1998
thus, the hot internet stocks could have another 20-30% to go before mature
for turning short
i.e. NEWM (NKD Vertriebs) /Zookiosk (AMZN) may see 400/200 resp.
