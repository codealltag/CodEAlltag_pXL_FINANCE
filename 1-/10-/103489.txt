The quantum index's probability chart shows that Dollar/Swiss Franc has a
critical point at 1.3807 +/- 0.0116 and a critical resistance point at
1.4155. If the down trend momentum of Dollar/Swiss Franc resumes and
penetrates through 1.3576, the market may test the supporting strength of
1.3228. See details at http://zpxvosa.fjlrxw.ybp/cyavsu Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0116 and all projected chart points are interrelated and are
separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0116 point. This forecast is bsed
on a mathematical model and it may or may not predict the market movement
accurately.
