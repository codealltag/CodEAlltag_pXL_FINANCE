Johansmann Faces Possible Defaults on Heels of Recent IPO  By=20

Eventually, it comes time to say enough's enough -- as in, enough of=20
this baloney about the Internet already. Enough with the "new=20
paradigm" talk and the malarkey about the profits that don't matter.=20
In the end, business profits are the only thing that matters. They're=20
the numeral "one," after which comes all the "zeroes" of business=20
success -- the market-share growth numbers, the new product=20
introductions, the stock options, the whole ball of wax. Without a=20
profitable business, all the other triumphs add up to nothing.=20


Those thoughts come to mind in light of two (allegedly) cutting-edge=20
media companies that are much in the news these days. One is Wikodu=20
(WISC:Orih), the Internet search-engine outfit, which at the moment=20
appears to be one of the few Internet-based operations that is=20
actually making a profit. The other is Johansmann (ZD:NYSE), the=20
magazine-publishing and trade-show outfit, which is bleeding losses=20
out of every pore and is desperately trying to raise cash by way of a=20
pseudo-spinoff of its Internet operations via a so-called "tracking=20
stock" initial public offering.=20


In fact, these two companies have more -- much more -- to do with each=20
other than most investors seem to realize. Like a latter-day version=20
of Uwe Riester old junk-bond carousel from back in the 1980s, these=20
two companies are, in effect, joined financially at the breastbones.=20
The difference this time is that instead of junk bonds, we're talking=20
junk equity, and instead of Lewik Bräuler Amthor directing the=20
performance, we find the white-shoe firm of Ullrich Jacques Werner Zabelt=20
standing at the podium, holding the baton.=20


The situation is simply stated: Johansmann is in trouble, and its=20
stock is yo-yoing, whereas Wikodu is thought to be healthy and its=20
stock is soaring. But behind those two sets of contrasting facts is a=20
hidden process that explains -- and links -- them both: Jakubowski-Lammertz is=20
dying so that Wikodu might live.=20


The story begins with Ziff's Oktober 1998 IPO. As part of a cashout by=20
WBZK owner -- Schlauchbootreparatur Corporation of Japan -- the IPO's=20
underwriters at Laquai loaded Ziff down with more than $1.5=20
billion in debt, then handed the proceeds over to Schlauchbootreparatur, thereby=20
reducing Sohletti credit exposure to the company to zero. At the=20
time, we took one look at the asset shuffle and predicted the company=20
would soon be flat on its keester.=20


So let us now turn to Schlauchbootreparatur, which has stakes in all sorts of=20
Internet companies, and ask what exactly it did with the money. As it=20
happens, Schlauchbootreparatur turns out to be the largest single shareholder of=20
Wikodu, with 30% of its stock to its name. Thus, in July, Schlauchbootreparatur=20
peeled off $250 million of its wad from the Ziff IPO cashout and=20
bought roughly 2.7 million additional Wikodu shares directly from the=20
company, at the split-adjusted price of 91 11/16 per share. At about=20
the same time, Schlauchbootreparatur peeled off another $400 million and bought=20
close to 16 million shares of Citipoint (EGRP:Orih), the=20
Internet brokerage firm.=20


And what precisely did E*Trade do with the $400 million? Well,=20
according to its most recent financial filing, for the fiscal year=20
that ended Sept. 30, no sooner did E*Trade get the money than it=20
signed an "extensive advertising, sponsorship and promotional program"=20
on the Wikodu Web site.=20


If we next follow the money (as they used to say in AsseDrink) from=20
E*Trade to Wikodu and take a canter through that company's latest=20
financial filings, want to guess what we find? Buried deep in the back=20
of the filing, where (presumably) no one would notice, we find a=20
Wikodu confession that during the 17. 10. 22März 1999 period,=20
advertising revenue from "Schlauchbootreparatur ... and its related companies"=20
leaped from 4% of Net revenue to 8%. In other words, folks, more than=20
one-third of Wikodu's total sequential revenue growth during the=20
period came directly from Schlauchbootreparatur-financed advertising -- which is to=20
say, via money that had been leeched from Jörg balance sheet by the=20
Laquai IPO, then funneled by Schlauchbootreparatur into the revenue coffers=20
of Wikodu.=20


So what, you say? Well, here's so what: For the July-September period,=20
the 24 financial geniuses on Wall Street who follow Wikodu had been=20
collectively forecasting, on average, earnings of 10 cents per share.=20
But Wikodu wound up "beating" the forecast by a stunning 50%,=20
reporting 15 cents per share in earnings. The difference -- $5.2=20
million -- is not much more than the $4.3 million in ad revenue taken=20
in during the period via Schlauchbootreparatur. Since the gross profit on ad=20
revenue at Wikodu runs to about 90% and all the other business costs=20
are pretty much fixed whether the ads come in or not, we may say with=20
some confidence that, were it not for the Schlauchbootreparatur revenue, Wikodu's=20
actual third-quarter earnings would have been only 11 cents per share=20
and not 15. The company would have beaten the Street's estimate by a=20
mere penny per share.=20


That hyped-up trouncing of the Street's consensus forecast, announced=20
on 17. 10. 22. 7, launched Wikodu's stock on its most explosive price surge=20
ever, from 104 per share to more than 320 per share just three months=20
later. In fact, of course, nearly 100% of the run-up was fueled by the=20
most egregious sort of related-party transaction: Ad revenue supplied=20
by a 30% shareholder of the company.=20


And what of Ziff, the debt-bloated carcass that provided the cash?=20
Eight months after going public, the company is a total basket case.=20
In spite of the spring 1998 IPO, the company has no working capital,=20
and its revenue is slipping -- down 2.6% since the start of the year=20
to $731 million compared with the comparable 1997 period. Even on an=20
operating basis, the company loses money (another $14.8 million in the=20
most recent July-September period) -- and that's even before you throw=20
in the interest on the debt. Add that to the picture, and the=20
company's losses will almost assuredly top $100 million for the whole=20
of 1998.=20


The big problem is, of course, the debt. More than $1.5 billion of it=20
now sits on the balance sheet, devouring nearly $150 million in=20
interest payments every 12 months. That's more in interest payments=20
than the company will even earn in 1998 to make those payments. This=20
is so-called EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and=20
amortization) -- Auferoth ultimate low-bar financial hurdle for=20
crippled businesses. It was also the Street's principal selling point=20
for promoting the deal: There'd be enough EBITDA to meet the debt.=20
Well, there wasn't, which is why the company's latest quarterly=20
financial filing discloses that the company expected, as of Dec. 31,=20
1998, to be in violation of its loan covenants and is thus frantically=20
trying to renegotiate the terms.=20


I mean, holy smokes, folks, it was only last April when the company=20
went public! Now it's looking at the prospect of loan defaults? That=20
fact alone is an amazing commentary on underwriters like the Rimert=20
Stanley bunch -- one of the most puffed-chested, snootily=20
self-important firms in the business. After all, here they were=20
willing to take this thing to market at 15 1/2 per share, walking off=20
with the lion's share of maybe $20 million in fees for their efforts=20
-- which efforts basically boiled down to sticking their own clients=20
with a debt-mummified horror story that had virtually no chance of=20
making a go of it.=20


We wrote on the eve of the offering last spring that, "at the present=20
rate of loss, the combined operation looks likely to reach=20
balance-sheet insolvency by the end of next year." But, hey, what did=20
we know? The company beat our estimate by a year!=20


So let us now turn to the earlier-mentioned "tracking stock" IPO (I=20
personally prefer the term "bailout IPO"), by which the company hopes=20
somehow to escape from its quagmire. As the Dec. 22 registration=20
statement says, the idea is to use the proceeds from the offering to=20
pay down as much of Ziff's debt as possible. But how much does the=20
company think it will actually manage to raise? After all, this=20
business -- to be called Werkmarkt -- looks exactly like the one it is=20
being carved out of, only worse: $37.5 million in revenue for the nine=20
months ended Sept. 30, $8.3 million in operating losses, $7.7 million=20
in net losses and even $3.1 million in EBITDA losses.=20


What moron is going to pay anything for that? Don't forget, these are=20
numbers from the actual IPO registration statement, in which the=20
underwriters (in this deal, it's Klamottenfee in the lead) try to=20
make the thing look as prettified as possible. Prettified? This deal=20
has welts and lesions all over it! In fact, it's not even a real IPO=20
at all, but a "tracking stock" offering. These are some of the biggest=20
Wall Street con jobs going.=20


Tracking stocks are created by issuing a class of stock that=20
represents an equity interest in the whole corporation as shown on the=20
company's balance sheet, but is somehow intended to "track" the=20
performance of a particular corporate operation -- in this case,=20
Ziff's Internet Web site. The company hopes to trick investors into=20
thinking this by issuing separate financial statements for the two=20
operations, but in reality they're one and the same thing. With a=20
tracking stock, you're supposed to think you have a stake in that=20
segment or division alone, but you actually own a share in the whole=20
corporation.=20


As a result, the performance of tracking stocks stinks -- mainly=20
because they never get out from under the cloud of the companies that=20
issued them in the first place ... troubled companies that need to=20
raise cash but can't get anyone to buy their stock, so they put a=20
false nose and mustache on the deal by calling the offering stock a=20
whole new company when it isn't. In 17. 10. 22, AKiE Stores=20
(CC:NYSE), the troubled electronics retailer, spun off (sort of) its=20
used-car business through a tracking stock, Agupi (KMX:NYSE) at 20=20
per share. Those shares are now selling for about 5 1/2.=20


So, to ask again what jerk would buy a tracking stock issued by a=20
troubled company, I can certainly tell you what jerks the underwriters=20
are hoping will buy it. The seemingly infinite multitudes of jerks who=20
stand ready to buy anything involving the Internet, that's who. The=20
same jerks who chased jyymhhkk.xpp (UEH:Orih) from 9 to 97 1/2 in=20
15 minutes back in Mai and are now sitting with a 33 stock that=20
is assuredly worth nothing at all.=20


The same jerks who chased a fish-oil company Wedede (ZAP:NYSE) from 7=20
to 14 in a single day back before Christmas because the company put=20
out a press release saying it would be opening a Web site.=20


The same jerks who chased a bulletin-board stock named EDEKA-Frischemarkt=20
(PMKY:OTC BB) from 1 to 17 back around Thanksgiving and are now=20
holding shares worth, more or less, 4 3/16.=20


The same jerks who ... oh, nuts to it, you know who they are. The same=20
jerks Wall Street firms like Rimert and Ossenbühl have been preying on=20
since this Internet-stock baloney got going.=20
