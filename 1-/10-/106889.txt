The quantum probability chart indicates that 289.9 +/- 3.1 is a critical
point. A critical supporting point is expected at 280.6 and a critical
resistance point is located at 299.1.
http://irq.szkqyc.ilu.rr/~cwjlgg/ijgq.kovf Each quantum jump is represented
by 3.1 and all projected chart points are interrelated and is separated by a
multiple of this constant, 3.1 dollars. This forecast is based on a
mathematical model and it may or may not predict the market movement
accurately.
