Spot silver has a critical point at 5.30 - 5.39 as suggested by the
probability chart of quantum index analysis(
http://fwx.qtoesw.npq.mt/~srlsdn/vhhmvz.evkh ). If the market momentum can
overcome the resistance at 5.39, spot silver will head for 5.58 and then it
will face strong resistance at 5.67 - 5.76. Each quantum jump is represented
by 0.09 and all projected chart points are interrelated and is separated by a
multiple of this constant, 0.09. A critical supporting point is located at
4.75. My view will be very negative if spot silver can not hold on to this
critical supporting point. This forecast is based on a mathematical model and
it may or may not predict the market movement accurately.
