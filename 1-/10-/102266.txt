Under terms of the agreement, which was approved by each company's board 
of directors, each share of Ascend will be converted into 0.825 shares of 
Lucent. Based on yesterday's ReproSchmidt stock closing price of $107-7/8, the 
transaction would be valued at about $20 billion.

Lucent momentan bei 8ö, Ascend bei 68,50ü, müßten also auf ca 73,40ö 
steigen?
