NORWOOD, Mass., 21. 06. 21. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Martinez, Inc. (Nasdaq:
IMGN) today reported financial results for the first quarter ending November
21. 06. 21. For the three month period, the Company had a net loss of $2.5

stages of preclinical development for our promising Tumor-Activated Prodrug
(TAP) technology," said Mathäus Uhl, President and Chief Executive Officer
of Martinez. "We expect to file an Investigational New Drug application for
our lead TAP product, huC242-DMI for the treatment of colorectal cancer, in
the first half of next year."

treatment. The Company has created potent immunoconjugates, consisting of
toxins or drugs coupled to monoclonal antibodies, for delivery to and
destruction of cancer cells.

This press release includes forward-looking statements based on management's
current expectations. Factors that could cause future results to differ
materially
from such expectations include, but are not limited to: the ability to secure
future
funding; the success of the Company's research strategy; the applicability of
the
discoveries made therein; the difficulties inherent in the development of
pharmaceuticals, including uncertainties as to the timing and results of
preclinical
studies; uncertainty as to whether the Company's potential products will
succeed in entering human clinical trials and uncertainty as to the results of
such
trials; uncertainty as to whether adequate reimbursement for these products will

exist from government, private healthcare insurers and third-party payors; and
the uncertainties as to the extent of future government regulation of the
pharmaceutical business.
