The Quantum Probability chart shows that Dollar/Swiss Franc has a critical
supporting point at 1.337 +/- 0.0133 and a critical resistance point at
1.4432. Dollar/Swiss Franc is likely to vibrate between 1.3636 to 1.4034 +/-
0.0133 early this month. http://jza.nithkd.utm.eo/~smnfbu/bii.jzqy Each
quantum jump is represented by 0.0133 point and all projected chart points
are interrelated and is separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0133
point. This forecast is based on a mathematical model and it may or may not
predict the market movement accurately.
