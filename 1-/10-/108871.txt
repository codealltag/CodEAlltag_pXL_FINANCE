The answer is, "both!" It all depends upon how carefully you select, study,
and buy into these businesses. There are all sorts of companies among the
"pennies". They range from outright shell games which sell nothing but hopes
and promises, to honest startups, with new ways to solve old problems. Mixed
among them are the fallen angels, copy-cat "wanna-bes", and a host of third
rate companies which will fail or just muddle around for a variety of
reasons.

Your job is to find the needle in the haystack--the penny stock that will one
day be a superstar. How? You must develop a system to screen out the weak
entries. This means you must eliminate virtually all mining, drilling, and
exploration companies; they are extremely risky, and make more money for
short term traders than for long term investors.

The ideal investment is one which has the possibility of substantial profit
with the least possible risk. These companies DO exist in the developmental
stage, in the penny stock market. Learn how to find them by reading more at
