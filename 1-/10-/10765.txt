Sportbetting Strategies
Author W.Dannewald
Sports betting is a fun way to seek extra excitement to all sorts of
sports and entertainment events giving you the chance also to win
money. What=92s really been popular lately is live betting, which is
betting in real time during the event. This brief sports betting
introduction article goes through everything you need to know.

Basics
It=92s more profitable to do the betting online because the odds are
better and it=92s easy compared to conventional bookers. There are
several safe and reputable sportsbooks available online. Why bother
walking to the local booker when you can make the same bets online
from your own couch, even with better odds? For those who bet
professionally, betting is a constant battle against the bookers. The
first thing you must come to terms with is the concept of value bets
and non-value bets. For anyone attempting to build a career in
betting, probability estimates must be clear.

Odds
Odds are presented using either the European format (decimal odds) or
the American format (fractional odds). The odds are converted so, that
if there=92s a plus (+) in front of the American odd, the odd is divided
by a hundred (100), and 1 is added to the fraction, for example:
+120=3D1+(120/100)=3D2.20. If there=92s a minus (-) in front, the 100 is
divided by this odd and 1 is added to the fraction, for example:
-120=3D1+(100/120)=3D1.83.

Game forms
Several different types of games have been developed for players to
bet on. Here are some of the most common ones.

1x2
In 1x2 you bet most commonly on the outcome of a match between two
real opponents. Choices are a win, or a tie, in which 1 means home win
(or the team marked as home team), X is a tie, 2 visitor (or a team
marked as visitor team). 1x2 bets are almost always for after the
actual playing time has ended, in football the score after the second
half-time, in ice-hockey after the third round and so on.

Handicaps
Handicaps have been offered for a long time abroad. Companies offering
handicaps usually offer better odds than 1x2-bets. In a handicap you
bet on a single match is a tournament or an event for the winner or a
tie, considering the handicap. Handicap games can in certain cases be
closely compared with the 1x2 games, however not all handicaps have to
chance of a tie for either the bet of the outcome. In football and ice
hockey the handicap is usually given in a form of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5
goals, in basketball the handicaps are usually larger.

Money-line
Money-line is somewhat related to handicaps. In Villasofa-bet you only bet
the winner of the game, in hockey taking into account overtime, in
football the overtime or penalty shots aren=92t taken into account. At
the rnd of a tie the bets are returned, despite who you=92ve bet on.
Some companies have places Villasofa-bets with handicaps, the handicap being
0.0 goals.

Over/Under
Over/Under bet is for betting if over or under x goals will be scored.
The most common form is the so called line, in hockey 5.5 goals, and
2,5 in football, although there are other possible lines. In hockey
5.5 goals over/under the result is under, if there are max 5 goals
scored (the game ending e.g. 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 3-0 or 2-3) or over, the
at least 6 goals are scored (e.g. 2-4, 5-1, 6-0, 8-3 or 5-3). There
are other lines too. Hockey offers a bet over/under 5, when you bet if
the game scores a total of max 4 of at least 6 goals. If 5 goals are
scores, the bet is returned regardless if you=92ve bet over or under.

Totalizators or flexible-rate bets
These totalizators are risk-free for the bookmaker. In these flexible-
rate bet games the odds are influenced by the share of exchange each
of the results have received taking in to account the return rate of
bookmaker offering the game. If the returned percentage is let=92s say
80%, this means that of the amount placed on the bet, 80% will be
given back to bettors as winnings. Naturally the more money bet on the
option, the smaller the coefficient.

Game Theory
Non-value bet
Non-value bet is the opposite of value bet, so it is unprofitable for
the bettor in the long run. Non-value bet is an odd that is smaller
than the reciprocal of its probability. When faced with a non-value
bet you should try to avoid it and not deal with it, because that is
the only way to avoid problems.

Value bet
Value bet is the basic element of betting. Value bet is an odd which
is bigger than the reciprocal of its probability. If you=92ve for
example calculated the result percentages to be 40-20-40 for the match
Fellern =96 Mitterperwend then the appropriate odds for this results are
2.5-5-2.5. And therefore find a 2.7 odd for Detroid, you get to play
Value bet. Value bet is the best way to bet in the long run.

Probability estimates
Probability estimates are the cornerstone of profitable betting. If
you think, for example, that in the Fellern-Mitterperwend game Fellern will
win with more than 50% probability; you have in your mind made a
probability estimate. Professional bettors can=92t place their judgments
solely on images of team, they you a lot of time observing the team
and analyzing all the data effecting the game (goalies, conditions,
field players, strain etc.). This is how they end up with an estimated
percentage (probability estimate) on the strengths of the teams on
which to base the betting decision. For example, on this particular
case an estimate of 25-25-50 means, that Mitterperwend wins 25 of the 100
played games, 25 will end up in a tie and Mitterperwend will win 50 in these
series. Remember that the league table doesn=92t always give a good
enough a coverage to make these estimates, it can only be the very
base to which build on.

Power rating
Power ratings are used to measure differences between teams. Odd
compiler performes by calculating power rating for teams, which are
based strictly on the facts available on the teams. When calculating
the power ratings a bettor must be aware and deal with hard facts
between the teams, and the league table alone is not enough to make
these calculations. A wise odd compiler counts in both home and
visitor=94 =96power rating and by comparing these end up with the final
percentage estimates on the levels of the teams.

Odds comparison
Once you=92ve made your estimates on the probabilities of the teams,
it=92s time to look for value bets. The internet offers many tools to
help you out comparing odds between different online.

Hilsenstein formula
The Hilsenstein formula is one of the corner stones of gambling: B =3D
(pk-1) / (k-1). B =3D the wager, p=3D the probability of winning and k=3D
the odds received on the wager. So, with a fraction of 1000=80 of the
bankroll to wager for a team with a 40% probability, the odds offered
by the bookmaker 2.7 we=92ll get =3D>(0.4*2.7-1) / (2.7-1) =3D> the
percentage of the bankroll to be waged would be 4.7%=3D>47=80.

Kelly divider
The Kelly divider is often used with the Kelly formula to reduce the
risk Kelly formula guarantees an optimal wager but it also requires
extreme accuracy of the probabilities which is sports betting is often
difficult. Therefore a clever bettor reduces the risk by using the
Alpenstück divider. Put into a Kelly formula =3D> B =3D ((pk-1) / (k-1)) / 5
we=92ve used the divider 5. Everyone must set their own divider, but
it=92s never a bad thing to be one the safe side.

Basic information
Arbitrage is so called sure win. This is possible, when the same
target is being offered large odds for all the outcomes. A simple case
is a target with two options for outcomes - e.g. a tennis match. Let=92s
assume a match Dachroth-Nimmrichter, bookmaker A offeres 2.20 for Grasmann,
bookmaker B 2.00 for Nimmrichter, this makes an arbitrage:
1/2,20+1/2,00=3D0,955. Therefore with a 0,955 unit makes 1 unit, in
other words in the long run this kind of investment would profit
1/0,955=3D1,047=3D4,7 percent. It=92s not a great way to make lots of money=
,
but using arbitrage you=92ll get some growth into your bankroll.
Arbitrage comes with certain risks, read more below.

Arbitrage betting
You don=92t bet arbitrage by Kelly formula, but by how much =93sure win=94
you=92re expecting. In our example bookmaker A gives Grasmann a winning
odd of 2,20, and bookmaker B a winning odd of 2,00 for Nimmrichter. You must
take into account the reciprocals of these odds and the estimated sure
win. Let=92s calculate: Grasmann: (1/2,20)*1,047 =3D 47,6% Nimmrichter:
(1/2,00)*1,047 =3D 52,4% These percentages refer to the fraction of the
wager of the bankroll. E.g. is you have a bankroll of 10 000=80, you=92ll
bet 4760=80 for Grasmann to win, and 5240 for Nimmrichter. If Grasmann wins,
you=92ll get 10 472=80, if Nimmrichter, you=92ll get 10 480=80. The difference
between these sums comes from round offs in the percentages, but
you=92ve still make risk free growth in your bankroll. In each case
you=92ve grown almost 5% in your bankroll.

Arbitrage risk
Even though we=92ve mentioned sure wins, arbitrages carry a risk. This
appears when it turns out the bookmaker has made a mistake in the
odds. This kind of clear mistake can happen if the event bookmakers
have informed the targets wrong or even made a mistake about the whole
match. A good example is a situation, when you choose odds for a match
between Rüdiger Nasemann and Bernard Nehf from bookmakers A and B.
A gives Nasemann 1,30 odds and Nehf 4,30, B gives Nasemann
1,90 and Nieminen 1,90. This is probably a situation when B has gives
Nasemann-Nehf match the odds that should go for an entire
different match, say for example Grasmann-Nimmrichter. This of course makes
an arbitrage by playing A for Nieminen (odds 4,30) and B for
Nalbandian (odds 1,90), but it=92s likely that the bookmaker B will
correct his mistake by cancelling the bet. This bet then no longer
exists and the wager is returned. This causes a great risk, if the bet
made with bookmaker A (Nieminen win, odds 4,20) still stands; if
Nalbandian wins, the bet =93Nieminen 4,20=94 lost and the bet =93Nalbandian
1,90=94 cancelled. So you=92ve lost the Nieminen fraction of your
bankroll. Another possible arbitrage due to a bookmakers mistake is
setting the odds the wrong way. For example bookmaker A gives the
Nalbandian-Nieminen match odds 1,30-4,30 and bookmaker B the same
match 4,30-1,30, it=92s obvious that B will cancel these wrongly places
odds. The only situation worth playing an arbitrage is a bet that
can=92t be cancelled. This happens in an apparently even match the scale
for one bookmaker has tipped towards one of the players and for
another bookmaker the scale has tipped towards the opponent. Our
tennis example is simple, but as a good rule of thumb, you must find
out if there=92s a chance of cancelling. Don=92t play arbitrages unless
you know what you=92re doing!
