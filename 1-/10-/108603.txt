The quantum frequency chart indicates that strong selling presuure is
required to push dollar/mark lower from 1.6646 to 1.6514
http://scm.dysisk.gzb.cu/~ajbnuq/iloopz-ozfx.kqpp and once the market can
establish itself at 1.6514, it is most likely that the momentum would carry
dollar/mark all the way down to 1.6382, as suggests by the quantum
probability chart of dollar/mark. Resistance is expected at 1.6778 - 1.691.
Each quantum jump is represented by 0.0132 and all projected chart points are
interrelated and is separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0132. This
forecast is based on a mathematical model and it may or may not predict the
market movement accurately.
