Dollar/Swiss Franc can easily move between 1.3860 and 1.4124 as indicated by
the frequency chart at http://osm.gcdukk.jqs.yd/~itdxfs/zfu.ucwm If the
market momentum is strong enough to overcome the resistance at 1.4256, my
view for Dollar/Swiss Franc would change from bearish to neutral. Each
quantum jump is represented by 0.0132 and all projected chart point are
interrelated and is separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0132. This
forecast is based on a mathematical model and it may or may not predict the
market movement accurately, see current comment at
