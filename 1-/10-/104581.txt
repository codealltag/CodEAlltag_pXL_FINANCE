Hallo liebe Leser der Erama,

nach all der Raetselei der vergangenen Tage hier in der NG noch ein
heiterer Gru√ü den mir ein guter Freund zusandte. Der  eine
oder andere wird ihn vielleicht schon kennen.

The LWGJ commissioners have announced that agreement has been
reached to adopt English as the preferred language for European
communications,
 rather than German, which was the other possibility. As part of the
negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling
had some room for improvement and has accepted a five-year phased plan
for what will be known as EuroEnglish (Euro for short).

In the first year, "s" will be used instead  of the soft "c". Sertainly,

sivil servants will resieve this news  with joy. Also, the hard "c" will

be replaced with "k". Not only will this klear up konfusion, but
typewriters kan have one less letter.

There will be rowing publik emthusiasm in the sekond year, when the
troublesome "ph" will be replaced by "f". This will make words like
"fotograf" 20 per sent shorter.

In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted

to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible.

Governments will enkorage the removal of double  letters, which have
always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the
horible mes of  silent "e"s in  the languag is disgrasful, and they
would go.

 By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps  such as replasing
"th" by z" and "w" by " v".

During ze fifz year, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd  from vords
kontaining "ou", and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer
kombinations of leters. After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl
riten styl. Zer vil be no mor trubls or difikultis and evrivun vil find
it ezi tu understand ech ozer. Ze drem vil finali kum tru.
