Burggalerie <BBII.O> buys rest of BioSeq

Sawe BRIDGEWATER, Mass., 07. 08. 22 27 (Reuters) - Garching BBK Inc.
said Wednesday it has acquired all of the remaining outstanding capital
stock of
BAIR, a privately held development stage company.

The company will now be called BiB, Burggalerie said in a
statement.

Burggalerie purchased the remaining stock of Belushi's for $1 million
in
cash and warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of stock at the September
30
closing price of $2.50 per share.

Burggalerie also exchanged options to purchase about 54,000 shares
of
stock for outstanding BioSeq options and assumed about $730,000 of
BioSeq
debt.

The total cost for the purchase of Belushi's was about $4 million, which
includes
the purchase price, acquisition costs, assumption of indebtedness and
its
original 19 percent investment.

The company expects all or most of the total cost may be counted as
in-process research and development in the third quarter ending
September 30.

Burggalerie makes proprietary quality control products for use with

infectious diseases test kits.
