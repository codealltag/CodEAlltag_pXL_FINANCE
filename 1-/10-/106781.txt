The market has triggered a negative signal and my view is bearish for
dollar/mark. It is heading towards 1.6152 as suggested by quantum probability
chart, with a stepping stone located at 1.6417. The resistance is now at
1.6814 and the market can easily vibrate between 1.6814 and 1.6417 as shown
in the quantum frequency chart. A critical resistance point is located at
1.7211. http://igqyxyq.ghijoa.suc/tqqagl/ Each quantum jump is represented by
0.0132 and all projected chart points are interrelated and is separated by a
multiple of this constant, 0.0132 points. This forecast is based on a
mathematical model and it may or may not predict the market movement
accurately.
