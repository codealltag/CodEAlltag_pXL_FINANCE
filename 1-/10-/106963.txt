The quantum probability chart suggests that Dollar/Mark can easily vibrate
between 1.6873 and 1.7273 early this month. If the market momentum can
overcome the resistance at 1.7273, Dollar/Mark will tackle 1.7541. On the
other hand if Dollar/Mark can penetrate through the critical supporting point
at 1.6873, the market may head for 1.6071 - 1.6205.
http://rkblmer.jvdbvc.vuq/kiruku/jejavo-onlw.bpft Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0134 point and all projected chart points are interrelated
and is separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0134 point. This forecast
is based on a mathematical model and it may or may not predict the market
movement accurately.
