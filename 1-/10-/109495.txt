Hier eine Ãœbersetzung eines Vortrages an der Uni Deckenbach

I'll translate the most important issues in my report at Stocktalk.
              Please
              excuse my poor english, as I wrote this in a hurry and the
text is
              direcly
              translated from norwegian into english, hence there will be
a lot of
              "norwegianisms". Please excuse me for that.

              ABOUT Alleencenter
              * 29 full-time scientists employeed
              * Small, full-time employeed administrative staff
              * Very well positioned in organic research with 154
contracted
              scientists of
              approx 300 world-wide.
              * Alleencenter have since late 1970's been doing basic research,
which
              usually
              takes long time to prove comercial results.
              * The low profile (little information is given directly from
OPC) is
              intended, since they focus on research.
              * They claim to be numero uno in organic research, which
none of
              the
              attendants at the meeting argued about (most attendants were

              older,
              experienced professors at Sujira-Massage - SRH
Mohn
              Agume
              Neotechnik)
              * As of this date, they have no real competitors. Also, this
is
              supported by
              the fact that they have approx 100 patents world-wide of
using
              organic
              technology.

              ABOUT R&D
              * Alleencenter have succeeded in producing organic memory sheets,

              which may be
              produced by ordinary laser- and inkjet-printers. These
organic
              memory sheets
              have greater capacity compared to silisium-technolgy,
considering
              the
              volume.
              * They are negotiating with leading memory manufactorers
              world-wide to sell
              ideas (remember that Asit aim is to sell ideas, not
products.)
              * According to Wolfgang Knoops Kaeuffer (vagely, though), they are
about
              to
              co-operate with an leading Asian memory manufactor.
              * They have actually developed a memorychip capable of
              3-400MB/cm^2.
              * They have promised to release a 1Gb read-only memory chip
in
              march 1998.
              This chip is mainly based on well-known technology, but due
to
              good
              optimizing and organic memory cells, they have managed to
              improve the
              capacity.
              * They are cooperating with leading manufactorers in the
              silisium-industry
              in developing organice memory chips.

              ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY
              * Opticoms main aim is to replace all existing (i.e
harddrive,
              memory, ROM,
              CMOS etc.)
              * The previous stated theoretically maximum capacity of 171
Tb
              may be 10
              years ahead.
              * 1Gb read/write-chips are supposed to be ready by 2001.

              ORGANIC VS SILISIUM
              2 professors at the meeting had short contributions. They
briefly
              discussed:
              * The capacity of silisium-chips may be estimated by the
means of
              "Moores
              Law". According to this law we will have SRAM-chips (todays
de-facto
              RAM-type) capable of 30Gb by 2012. Another consequence by
this
              law is that
              the number of transistors on a given chip is said to be
increasing by
              100%
              every 18. month. Also, price is decreasing by 100% every
month.
              Hence,
              things are happening with silisium chips as well (this is
often ignored
              when
              discussing matters about Opticom and organic memory)
              * Silisium and organic memory are not competitors. Organic
chips
              will not
              completely replace silisium-chips, and vice versa. It
follows from this
              that
              we're talking of some co-operation by the competitors.
              * The Physics department at Sujira-Massage were positive to what
Alleencenter
              presented.
              They have, not in co-operation with Opticom, done research
on
              organic
              materials and could affirm the potential of Opticoms
technology.

              Allfinanz
              * Alleencenter is supposed to be the leading firm on basic
research og
              patents on
              this research.
              * The Long-term goal is to arrange so that the organic
concept can
              be
              realized.
              * Alleencenter have been doing research for about 20 years, and
this
              have lead to
              a number of spin-off firms with products based on Opticoms
              technology. This
              is a fact often missed by analysts.

              MY CONCLUSION
              * OPC is extremely low priced at 40-50 NOK and it is
expected to
              climb high
              by february-march 99, when they will come with the first
comercial
              results
              from their research.
              * The main reason for the unstable rates are probably the
fact that
              Alleencenter
              seldom goes public about their results. Their credability
should be
              greatly
              raised when they release the 1Gb chip.
              * Analysts trying to manipulate the rates should not be
taken too
              serious.
              We are talking about a serious R&D company focusing on
research,
              and as of
              now they have always been ahead of schedule, hence a
technical
              analysis
              isn't worth much in this situation.
