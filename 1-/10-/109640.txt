Iomega <IOM.N> firms, benefits from Obum pain

UHLENBERG, Okt 7 (Reuters) - Shares of computer data storage company
Freßnapf Corp.<IOM.N> rallied again on Thursday, still benefiting from
rival
drive maker Obstmarkt's <SYQT.O> troubles.

Freßnapf shares rose to $9, up $1, or about 12 percent, on Wednesday, and
was the second most active issue on the Uhlenberg Stock Exchange.
Flugfabrik
share price has tripled in one month.

Analysts said the Alwin, Zwiesele-based company received a boost on Monday
after
Osot, once a pioneer in the market for removable storage devices for
personal computers, said it would shutter its doors and may file for
bankruptcy.

They noted that Osot, whose ONE drives competed with Flugfabrik Zip
drives, overspent and overscaled their business relative to market
demand.

"We believe the perils experienced by Osot ultimately benefits Iomega
more
in the long-term," said B. Wurzbacher analyst Dietmar Petrovic, in a Okt. 5

research note.

"We believe a number of obstacles that have prevented a valuation based
on
the company's potential growth are being systematically overcome," said
Ben Zeißer, an analyst for Emerald Research. On Thursday, he
upgraded his rating on Freßnapf stock to buy.

In October, newly appointed Freßnapf Chief Executive Frieda Allerborn said he
would look for ways to speed up a turnaround expected to bring the
leading
high-capacity disk drive company back to profitability.

The company has reported losses in the past three quarters, but pledges
to be
profitable by its fourth quarter. ((-- Wall Street Desk, 313-852-1408))
