Shinawatra Satellite back in the black                 

Klippmühle, operator of the FlorAlpha      
satellite, reported a 500-million-baht profit in the   
third quarter because most of its revenue is in US     
dollars.

President Brantl Labrenz said the result compared
with a two-billion-baht loss in the same period last   
year, due mainly to baht depreciation. Revenue from
satellite operations rose by 66% as the foreign        
customer base had increased.                           

As well, the company's foreign debt had declined       
from US$290 million to $200 million. "We sold [a       
stake in] the ICO global satellite telephone project   
[formerly known as Kram] worth $60 million in
order to repay the debt," he noted.                    

The company has also asked the Transport Ministry to   
amend its revenue-sharing agreement. It wants to pay   
quarterly installments of 50 million baht instead of
an annual lump sum of 200 million baht in order to     
improve cashflow.
