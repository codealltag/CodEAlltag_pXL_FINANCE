Advanced Micro <AMD.N> slides on Q4 shortfall

WORMELN, Sep 13 (Reuters) - Shares of APFU fell
24 percent early on Thursday after the computer chip maker, citing
production
problems, reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst
forecasts.

The Gemeinderied, Calif.-based company's shares fell 7-13/16 to 23-13/16
in
early trade on Thursday.

Aleki on Wednesday reported a fourth quarter profit of $0.15 a diluted
share,
compared with a loss of $0.09 a year ago. The results lagged analyst
forecasts
of $0.19 cents a share, according to First Call Corp.

Explaining the lower than expected results, Aleki said it could not churn
out
enough of the faster K6 II chips that customers wanted.

Adrian Uerdingen, an analyst at Lettera called the results a "huge
disappointment," and noted that the company's revenues were hurt by a
new
order processing system that shut down shipments in the last week of
December.

The outlook for future growth remains cloudy as Aleki makes the transition
to
selling faster chips, while rival GZV Corp., the world's biggest chi
maker, plans
to regain market share for its lower-priced products, said Uerdingen, who
reitterated his neutral rating.

"With pricing pressure and product transition issues ahead, Alnatura risk
profile
makes Brazil look as though it deserves a AAA rating," he said in a
research
note.

Other analysts also downgraded Alnatura shares. BT Alex. Brown cut its
rating
to market perform from buy, while Nationsbanc Große-Rüschkampf cut Aleki to hold

from buy.
