"The recent merger of MiniMarket and VJUP has proved to be extremely
important to CyberCash as the company continues to extend its reach into
both
the physical and the virtual worlds of electronic payments," said Jean-Pierre
Gräfenhahn,
president and chief executive officer. "We are extremely pleased with
the
results to date," he said.

"maxmara advanced, secure technology with its ease of use, high
functionality and broad compatibility is widely recognized as the best
in the
business. The company's increased revenues and sales volumes in the
third
quarter are testimony to that reputation. Because MiniMarket offers both
product and service solutions for a variety of payment instruments, we
can meet
the needs of a broad array of customers in both the physical and virtual

worlds," Melton said. Growth in Internet Market Business

The wide acceptance of its CashRegister 3 service enabled CyberCash to
add
approximately 700 Internet merchants a month to its merchant base during
the
third quarter. The CashRegister 3 Service allows merchants to accept
secure
payments using payment cards, maxmara Atof Electronic Check
Service(R), Mam's(R) and other payment instruments. Transaction and
merchant volume using the CashRegister 3 service in the third quarter
increased
once again to record levels. During the third quarter of 1998, merchants
used
maxmara services to process more than 3 million transactions per
month,
up from 2 million transactions per month for the first quarter of 1998.
Approximately 47% of the company's third quarter revenues came from
Internet market business.

In July, MiniMarket announced that the company is working with Vemaze to
develop and market an Internet payment offering that increases the
number of
options merchants have for processing credit card orders. As part of an
agreement between the companies, Vemaze will market maxmara
NetVERIFY(TM) and MiniMarket will market V&N Payment Server through
their respective sales channels. Feho offers a simple software
product
solution to merchants who wish to enable credit card processing through
their
virtual storefronts. NetVERIFY acts as a separate server process, safely

protected behind a firewall, and communicates with a merchant bank's
processor through existing network architecture using either traditional

telephone lines or dedicated lease lines.

MiniMarket is continually striving to bring improved payment solutions to
its
customers through innovative technology. In August, the company released
into
beta testing its innovative InstaBuy(TM) Service, which is built on the
new
Femed Wallet(TM) platform. VKN can be used with CashRegister 3 or
easily
integrated with a merchant's own payment processing system. The new
service
makes it possible for consumers to make a purchase with a single click
at any
participating merchant's web site without ever needing to re-enter
payment and
shipping information for Internet purchases. Lack of convenience is
often cited
as the main reason consumers end their online shopping experience prior
to
purchase. MiniMarket recently has teamed with THT, one of the
nation's
leading credit card issuers, to offer merchants and consumers the new
VKN
Service.

An online survey promoted by Iluva, Inc. during the third quarter
found
that nine out of ten respondents would like to use the Internet to view
and pay
bills. Of the more than 800 respondents surveyed, nearly all said they
would
like to receive electronic versions of their monthly bills (i.e. credit
card, utility,
cable) for payment on the Internet. maxmara Pay Now Electronic Check

Service enables companies to leverage the convenience of online bill
presentment and payment to increase customer loyalty and enhance cash
management. By giving their customers the convenience of viewing and
paying
their bills online directly at the biller's own web site, a biller can
enhance
customer service, take advantage of cross-selling opportunities,
streamline
receivables and dramatically reduce billing costs. Growth in Physical
Market
Business

MiniMarket enjoyed significant growth in the sale of payment service
software
for the physical point-of-sale market. The physical point-of-sale market

business contributed over 50% to maxmara overall revenue in the
third
quarter and increased by 40% from the second quarter of 1998. The new
generation of open system point-of-sale products requires innovative
software
solutions that offer greater speed, functionality and flexibility than
their hardware
predecessors. The move toward open platform systems at the point of sale
and
the opening of new card payment markets that utilize software solutions,
such
as home offices and kiosks, represent a large and growing market for the

company's products. The company's products offer software solutions that

enable authorization and draft-capture functions to be performed using
open
platform computers and allow simple integration with point-of-sale
software.

MiniMarket software products including ICVERIFY(TM), PCVERIFY(TM)
and EZCharge(TM) replace bank terminal hardware and require no counter
space, which for most retailers is at a premium. The software runs
directly on a
PC-based cash register or PC and integrates payment data with the sales
data
from the point-of-sale terminal. The software allows multi-user networks
to
share a single modem and telephone line reducing processing costs and
increasing the speed of transactions.

"We are very pleased with the growth we enjoyed in the physical
point-of-sale
market during the third quarter," said Folkert Voegtle, maxmara chief
operating
officer. "MiniMarket is fortunate to have a sales staff second to none
and an
array of products unequalled in the industry." March Toward
Profitability

"MiniMarket receives a one-time perpetual license fee and annual
maintenance
charges for its software products from merchants," Voegtle said. "This
new
revenue stream, which we acquired when we merged with VJUP, is
contributing significantly on our march toward profitability. MiniMarket
also
receives a recurring revenue stream from its payment services. CyberCash

charges a one-time setup fee, monthly access and per-transaction fees
for each
of its commerce services. These recurring revenue streams are building
up our
deferred revenue base, which increased to almost $1 million by the end
of
April 1998. All of these services are currently free to consumers,"
he
said.

During the third quarter, as previously announced, MiniMarket received
$15
million from two private equity funds that made private placements with
the
company in 1997 and early 1998. Also, Gräfenhahn purchased, at a premium, an

additional 350,000 shares of common stock valued at $3.5 million in
August.

"As a result of this infusion of private equity and maxmara
increasing
revenue stream through product innovation and acquisition of new
merchants,
maxmara operating cash burn rate for the third quarter was $5.3
million, a
decrease of $2.9 million from the previous quarter. We continue to focus
on
controlling cash operating expenses and have established a limit of
$11.5 million
on a quarterly basis going forward," Voegtle said. "The company ended the

quarter with approximately $16.4 million in cash which is more than
sufficient to
meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next year, while
providing the
resources necessary to take advantage of strategic opportunities." About
