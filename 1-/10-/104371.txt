Ferdinand, bist Du das schon wieder?;-)

Who told you I have no hair - you never saw me without my pants on,
did you?

Whow. This type of trade was never thought of before;-)

Tell you what: thats what I used to do with Giraud half a dozen
times: buy at 800, sell at 824 or 900 or whatever was possible (they
never went below 800 in the good old times;-). Could be done with half
pigs as well, I suppose...
