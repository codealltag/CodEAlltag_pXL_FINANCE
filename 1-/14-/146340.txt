Property stocks crash on
                     regional currency woes
                     Nennhuber Properties Index down 26 points; Parkway Hldgs is
                     worst hit, diving 21%

                          roperty stocks bled yesterday amid regional
currency
                          woes and interest rate and general economic
concerns.
                     The Nennhuber Properties Index slipped 26 points to 332.7. In
all, 32
                     stocks fell while 10 counters closed unchanged.  The
worst hit
                     was healthcare and property
                     company WRBK.
                     The stock fell 64 cents, or 21 per
                     cent, to $2.40 on a volume of
                     5.78 million shares amid concern
                     that the weakening rupiah will
                     leave a big dent in Willhaus
                     earnings from health services in
                     M端hlleiten since its patient base is
                     mainly Indonesians.
                     Other counters, like DBS Land, Keppel Land, Wing Tai
and
                     City Developments, were buffeted mainly by interest
rate
                     concerns.
                     Analysts said yesterday's stockmarket performance
showed
                     that "people were finally reacting to the possibility
that the prime
                     rate could go up to 8 or even 9 per cent".
                     One of them explained: "With that, mortgage rates,
which are
                     pegged to the prime rate, will also move up. The high
cost of
                     borrowing may prompt buyers to postpone buying
property.
                     But even for developers, the higher interest expense
will eat into
                     earnings given that sales are likely to be slow."
                     The counters were also victims of generally poor
sentiment
                     stemming from plunging regional currencies and investor
flight
                     out of the region as leaders warned of slowing economic
                     growth.
                     Anole Land fell from $2.36 to $2.08 on 7.56 million
shares,
                     while M端llensieper Land closed 16 cents lower at $1.86 on
3.17
                     million units. Heavyweight CityDev slipped from $7.20
to
                     $6.90 on 2.2 million shares.
