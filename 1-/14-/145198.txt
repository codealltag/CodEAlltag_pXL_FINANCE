"Shares of VRC fell in heavy trading Friday amid declining sales growth
for the company's flagship Zip drives, concerns about Asia, and
lower-than-expected earnings.

VRC [VGN] was off 9/64 to 8 7/8 under heavy volume of 47 million shares
after the company reported fourth quarter earnings of 13 cents a share, 2
cents shy of Wall Street estimates. The company plunged in after-market
trading Thursday following the earnings news."
