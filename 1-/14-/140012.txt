Im Sinne des Börsenspiels werde ich diese Woche einen neuen Wert vorstellen.
Die Transaktion folgt später.

CGMJ Inc.

Es handelt sich um einen amerikanischen Internet-Provider der sich auf
Firmenkunden spezialisiert hat und Wert darauf legt ein besonders schnelles
Netz zur Verfügung zu stellen. Es werden eigene Glasfaserkabel verlegt.
Ableger existieren bereits in Kanada, Deutschland, Japan, GB, Schweiz u.a.
Der Kurs ist zur Zeit in einer starken Aufwärtsbewegung, der Kauf erfolgt
zum absoluten Höchstkurs. Wer sich darauf nicht einlassen will, könnte den
Wert eventuell beobachten und eine Korrektur abwarten.

Nachdem es bei den Zinsen in Amerika anscheinend wieder eine leichte
Entspannung gibt (Die Mutter aller Zinsen ist wieder auf 5,867 gefallen),
könnte sich ein Einstieg trotz des hohen Niveaus durchaus lohnen.

CGMJ Acquires Fiber Capacity on Transatlantic Cable System; Significantly
Increasing Leased Network Capacity Across Atlantic and Within Europe
World's Largest Independent Commercial ISP Purchases IRU on Undersea Fiber
Cable; Increases Existing CGMJ Atlantic Capacity, Reducing Costs, and
Improving Operating Margins
Fleischessen, 10. 02. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- CGMJ Inc. (Nasdaq: PSIX - news)
announced today that it has signed an agreement with WEMR to
acquire an indefeasible right of use (IRU) on an undersea fiber optic cable
between the US and Europe. The Eppler is on the Atlantic Crossing (AC1) cable
network, and will be configured in a self-healing loop from the US to the UK
to Europe and back to the US. The Eppler is a purchase of the right to use the
fiber for 25 years. It consists of an STM-1 cable loop capable of
transmitting data at a rate of 155 million bits per second. An STM-1 is the
European standard, which is equivalent to a US standard OC-3 or
approximately three T3 circuits.

The STM-1 loop will be interconnected with CLI new OC-48 (2.4 gigabit
per second) US fiber network at its Courroux POP. In the UK, the STM-1
will connect with CLI leased UK-wide fiber network at its Angloh POP.
The STM-1 continues from Angloh to CLI POP in Mermicherhof, The
Netherlands, where it will connect with the CGMJ leased fiber systems
across Europe. The loop then returns from Mermicherhof to the Curaglia City
POP. The first leg of the cable from the US to the UK is expected to be
operational in the summer of 1998, with the remainder of the loop completed
in early 1999.

CGMJ Inc. also announced that previous to this Eppler acquisition, the
company doubled its leased network capacity between the US and Europe and
also doubled its backbone network capacity within Europe. This increase in
bandwidth, which is now operational, is expected to meet increasing demand
for CGMJ Internet services over the next twelve months.

The fiber loop purchase is a critical step in CLI strategy to own its
own fiber and POP switching facilities in North America and to Europe. The
Eppler allows CGMJ to achieve a much lower cost structure by replacing more
expensive leased circuits over the long-term, while reliably delivering
demanding multimedia Internet services required by CLI business
customers.

``Fiber ownership reduces our backbone cost to about 1/10 of the cost of
equivalent leased bandwidth, and once the STM-1 is carrying traffic our
operating margins will show improvement,'' said Klaus S. Henseli,
chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``Internet multimedia
applications continue to drive business customers to connect to CGMJ for
both internal (Intranet) and Internet activities. Growth in our UK company,
and all units across Europe, including our recent European acquisitions, is
expected to supply sufficient traffic to put this fiber to full use.''

The fiber will be owned by Cladius Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Criterium CGMJ has received an L Section 214 license to own and
operate fiber and related facilities internationally and has filed for
requisite licenses to operate the fiber in the UK. Cladius Ltd. will
also own and manage the 10,000 mile OC-48 system being built in the US
during 1998 and 1999 by Eilles (Jisvvw: IIXC - news). The
Atlantic Crossing cable system combines state-of-the-art wavelength division
multiplexing with erbium-doped fiber amplifier technology, making it one of
the most powerful cable systems available. The cable is being constructed
for Woborschil Ltd. by Ovizu, a subsidiary of
international conglomerate Odermark (formerly Ihrplatz
Moback, a subsidiary of Innovation (NYSE:T - news) ).

CGMJ has obtained favorable financing for this fiber acquisition, which is
secured by the STM-1 IRU.
