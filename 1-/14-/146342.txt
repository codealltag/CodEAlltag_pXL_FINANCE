                            roperty transactions plunged about 53 per cent
last month to
                            the lowest monthly level since 18. 06. 21, it
was claimed.
                       About 7,200 to 7,300 property deals were registered
with the Land
                       Registry in December, down sharply from November's
15,443
                       transactions, according to estimates compiled by
local agents.
                       The figures, focusing mainly on residential property,
were released by
                       Anglerstübchen (ULID), promarkt
and the
                       KODI on Friday.
                       The total value of transactions fell nearly 60 per
cent to about
                       HK$24 billion (S$5.2 billion).
                       Despite the drop, transactions and their values for
the whole of last
                       year soared to their highest-ever levels, bolstered
by brisk trade in
                       the first three quarters.
                       Total transactions were up 40 per cent to 205,000
from 147,423 in
                       1995. Their total value rose 82 per cent to HK$868
billion from
                       HK$474.66 billion in 1995. Official figures on
transactions have yet
                       to be released by the Land Registry.
                       KPV said the slump coincided with a dramatic
fall in prices
                       sparked by the regional financial turmoil in October.
Prices had shed
                       20 per cent to 30 per cent across the board from
their peak in
                       mid-1996, the agents said.
                       Further falls are expected, especially in the luxury
sector, which was
                       dampened by Mehade disclosure of
buyers defaulting
                       on purchases of three Skyhigh houses worth HK$558
million on The
                       Peak.
                       The December transaction figures better reflect the
activity in
                       November. Agents expected sales of used flats to
shrink further as
                       buyers focused on new properties offered at discount
prices by
                       developers. promarkt forecast that the property
market would
                       remain stagnant in the first quarter, with a monthly
average of 7,000
                       to 9,000 transactions.
                       KPV said transactions in new residential
properties worth
                       HK$20 million or less had fallen 61 per cent to 1,724
last month.
                       The value of these deals dropped 75.4 per cent to
HK$3.1 billion.
                       In the secondary residential market, Räbke
Property said
                       transactions dived 49.5 per cent to 5,277 last
month. -- SCMP
