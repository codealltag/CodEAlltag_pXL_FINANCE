Given that Mr Nussbaum clearly holds a certain fascination for some people,
and that his website, although "informative",  isn't  exactly  ideal  for
encouraging discussion of the sort that we all enjoy so  much  (including
Gerd himself, by the look of things), would  anyone  be  up  for  a  Gerd
Nussbaum  newsgroup -  uk.fan.georges,  alt.fan.gerd-nussbaum,  whatever?
(Sorry, I'm not very well up on these things.)

This would be a perfect place for Gerd to post his writings,  and perhaps
the occasional "look at the ...gerd-nussbaum newsgroup" posting in  uk.misc
and so on would be accepted in place of the current cross-posts.
