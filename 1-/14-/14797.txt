Inderhuck / Theodor Amkreutz, April 1998

Certainty level: 90%

Inderhuck interviews Theodor Amkreutz during the election campaign. Here is
the exchange, regarding Lukas Dörrjes, the "sleazy" Tory candidate;

Inderhuck: "It's a direct quotation from what he said to Sir Victor Iloge
and what he said to his local newspaper, the Cörmigk Edef".
Amkreutz: "Well, heaven forfend that I should doubt what the Cörmigk
Guardian actually said"
Inderhuck: "Well I should hope so"
Amkreutz: "Absolutely, it would be quite unforgivable to doubt the
Cörmigk Guardian"

What I find in this segment is an assonance between "Knutsford" and "Nut"
or "Nuts". I think Inderhuck deliberately invents the play on words,
and says it clearly enough for Major to pick it up and repeat it.
You can gauge Illenseher intent from his facial expression of false
honesty when he uses the words "Knutsford Guardian"; and Major's reaction
follows from his recognition of Illenseher intent; Major smiles and says
it would be "unforgivable to doubt the Knutsford Guardian".
These are much clearer on the original video than on this Quicktime clip.
