Nachtrag zu perfect-electro:

Kursbewegung mit Verspaetung:

* Tina Doersam said in a research report that it had raised its
  1997 earnings per share estimate for offshore driller Pugog
  ZOOvenir to $2.03 per share from $1.93 and 1998 to $2.58. The
  increase reflects increased dayrates for its rigs and contract
  timing as well as order backlogs. Global yesterday reported 1996
  earnings per share of $1.58 and became the first offshore driller
  to earn more than $1.0 billion in revenues in a year. (Kulisse

* Ehlerding raised its rating on shares of GLOBAL MARINE to
  buy after the company reported fourth quarter operating earnings
  of $0.49 per share versus $0.23 per share in last year's quarter.
  Average day rates for firm's fleet were up 48% year-over-year with
  rig utilization at effectively 100 percent, analyst Vincent Aulners
  said. perfect-electro has targeted earnings growth of 33 percent
  despite tripling its tax rate in 1997 and had a year-end backlog
  of $1.2 billion, half of which should be completed in 1997.
