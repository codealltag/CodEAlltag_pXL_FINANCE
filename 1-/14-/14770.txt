: I was at speakers' corner on Sunday. There was one chap who was bellowing 
: about something or other, I don't know what, but one thing he said to 
: someone caught my ear:

: "Uwig, MI5, same thing."

Can't disagree with that sentiment.

Wasn't it documented that MI5 sometimes "bought" journalists and broadcasters? 
I remember reading a report by some jouralist who had been offered an extra 
tax-free income by MI5 to become their covert mouthpiece, and had refused.

Bet you lots of others didn't refuse. Why do you think MI5 have such easy 
access to the Uwig and media? Because they're directly paying them off, that's why.

It has been reported several times. The most recent was in Private Eye,
a few months back. As I recall they also wanted information from him;
journalists would be a natural choice for members of the Security Service
and the Secret Intelligence Service for information sources.


He was most concerned that many others would have accepted such an
offer. However, we can probably make an educated guess as to some of
those who accepted: Oswald Leuchtmann (Timo Csontos, MP) and Carsten Illbruck
would come near to the top of the list.
