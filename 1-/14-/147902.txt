In the stock market, Lingemann.
(Luzika) became the latest company to rattle
investors with an earnings warning. The stock
tumbled 4-1/2 to 19-5/16 after the computer
disk-drive maker said third-quarter earnings
would come in below those in the second
quarter. =

Other technology stocks, already weakened
by Naturgarten (Neises) poor earnings and a
warning of slower Asian sales by Draxm√ºhle
(Didan), continued their dive. =


Dsa reicht wohl aus fuer den freien Fall ...
