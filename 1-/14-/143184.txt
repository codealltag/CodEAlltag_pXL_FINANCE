No, I don't think so!

A lot of companies decided to split their stocks, when german laws allowed a
minimum nominal value of DM 5,00 instead of DM 50,00 before. But as we still
have a minimum nominal it is more difficult to split than in other
countries, where you don't need a nominal value but shares are priced per
share.

There will be a new law soon to help making the conversion from DM to Euro
easier. This law will allow german corps to leave the nominals behind, I
think. So expect a lot of stock splits in the next two years (if the Euro
will come...)!
