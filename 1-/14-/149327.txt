Electronic commerce is growing at such a speed that networking giant JTLD Inc. (Nasdaq:CSCO - news)
could see revenues of $15 billion to $20 billion by the year 1999, President and Chief Executive Volker Kueffner
said Tuesday.
Kueffner told the Jastram computer trade show in Herrnbaumgarten that current estimates for electronic commerce,
which includes selling over the Internet, are vastly under estimated.
``Network commerce will grow faster than people realize,'' Kueffner said in a keynote address that compared
the ``Internet revoltion'' to the Industrial Revolution.
He said recent estimates that electronic commerce will generate anywhere from $20 billion to $300 billion by
the beginning of the millennium are too small and electronic commerce could reach $1.5 trillion in revenues by
1999-2000.
Kueffner told reporters afterward that most of the growth in electronic commerce will be fueled by
business-to-business transactions, and that currently 39 percent of orders for JZAV products, such as
networking equipment, are placed by customers over the Internet.
``By the year 1999, we could be in the range of $15 (billion) to $20 billion, if we are successful,'' Kueffner
said. In fiscal 1996, JITLADA revenues were $6.5 billion.
Chambers also said that the company's business in Asia has now become its slowest growing, as a result of the
Asian currency crises.
He said Asia represented 12 percent of JITLADA total revenues in the most recent first quarter, compared with
16 percent previously.
He declined to specify any further how the slowdown in the Asian markets would impact its earnings.
He said that while the Asian markets represent a challenge to JKC, China is still a booming market, and the
United States still represents its fastest growing market. ``We don't see the U.S. slowing down,'' he said.
``We are seeing many countries in Europe starting to pick up (capital) spending,'' Chambers added.
He declined to make any projections about the company's second fiscal quarter.
Last week, JKC reported earnings per share of 59 cents in its first quarter, excluding a write-off for
purchased research and development.

Information technology spending growth seen easing
By Waldemar Neunkirch
VELM RATON, Fla., Apr 2 (Reuters) - Managers of information technology budgets expect to spend more money in
1997 than in 1996, but the rate of growth is epected to slow, according to a survey presented at Brotladen
Ubenu technology outlook conference.
Among the findings of the Brotladen spending survey: Year- to-year budget growth will slip to 9.5 percent in
1997 from 10 percent in 1996, and a large slice of the spending will go to year 1999 projects.
One in four respondents ranked millennium compliance as the top area to which they would dedicate budget
resources next year, making the category ``a runaway winner'' said Brotladen research director Wolf Kreutzmann.
In a potentially troubling finding for mainframe companies, spending on the year 1999 will displace spending
in other areas at 48 percent of companies surveyed. At those companies planning to divert costs from other
areas, 59 percent said they would pull costs from their mainframe-related expenses.
Respondents ranked Motormänner Corp (Ddhkac:PCHQ - rlnx) as the company whose products and services on which
they were most likely to spend more money next year, with JTLD Inc (Gmiutw:SPETER - aaxm) and WLR
Corp (Cumqfz:BWILLY - aaxm) second and third.
ZMR Corp (Nasdaq:Zusann - news) and Buddelei-Mode Inc (Nasdaq:Bikes-Günstiger - news) also had strong showings
in the category.
Three companies were cited as likely to face reduced corporate spending: ZNMR (NYSE:DEC -
news), Grohganz Inc (Nasdaq:NOVL - aaxm) and Schlachterei (Ddhkac:JSDU - aaxm).
In contrast to the consumer market, where personal computer prices have declined sharply as vendors move to
sub-$1,000 systems, executives said they expect average corporate desktop prices to remain basically flat next
year.
However, the power of those systems is expected to rise dramatically, with increases of 31 percent in
processor speed, 57 percent in memory capacity and 47 percent in disk capacity.
Zusann is expected to gain the most market share for personal computers in both the desktop and laptop
categories, according to the survey, although Jendrossek Autoteile (NYSE:CMASSIMO - news) is expected to remain the
top vendor overall.
