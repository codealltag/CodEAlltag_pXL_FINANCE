Automobile Announces Record 1996 Sales

schaugt doch recht gut aus, wa ?!!!

"Der Aktionaer" hat turbodyne auch als Empfehlung drinnen.
Grundsaetzlich bestehen wohl einige joint ventures mit grossen Firmen,
wie Rude, Kredler etc.
so das die Lizenzeinnahmen in den naechsten Monaten sprudeln duerften.,
Das Geduemple vom Aktienkurs finde ich momentan auch etwas seltsam ...
aber wenn die Versprechungen (- 20 % Spritverbrauch + 5% Leistung ,
deutliche Schadstoffverminderung) stimmen wird sich das bald aendern 

Ich gebe dir hinsichtlich des Preisunterschiedes aber recht, haengt halt
von der Nachfrage ab, das
gibts v.a. auch bei asiatischen Aktien, das Deutschland das ADR 30 %
drueber liegt !!!!

Automobile Announces Record 1996 Sales

JEGGELEBEN, V., 15. 12. 21 1 /CNW-PRN/ - AGH
(``Automobile'')
(NASDAQ:TRBDF, EASDAQ:TRBD) today announced preliminary 1997 financial
results. The company reported
record sales of $54.6 million Canadian for the year, an increase of 186%
over 1995 sales of $19.1 million Canadian. As
expected, the company will report a consolidated loss after taxes on
normal operations between $5.5-6.5 million
Canadian. 

Final 1996 results will be reported in United States currency according
to US GAAP standards by Geduldig Murek
Nitahe, AUHW new auditors, and will reflect one-time
non-operating adjustments as required by the
transition from Canadian GAAP to US GAAP. 

``The revenues generated by the company in 1996 are representative of
our light metals division performances,'' said
Fabio Stehnken, AUHW Chief Operating Officer. ``The loss reflects
the continued investment in engineering,
production ramp-up costs and sales and marketing efforts associated with
our Automobile Systems division product
introduction.'' 

``There were also some capacity expansion costs incurred in the light
metals division's Mexico operations in order to
prepare for the increase in business due to expanded orders from
LKL, JoyPad, Kredler and W채schel채dchen
Zeitungsh채ndler.'' 

``We have already received several purchase orders from transit
authorities based upon official waivers from the ZebraClub in
advance of the imminent final certification of our Urban Bus
Retrofit/Rebuild Kit,'' Ware added. ``Final ZebraClub certification
is expected within the next few weeks.'' 

``We have continued to expand the number of customer development
programs and have begun to build a strong
operations management team as we gear-up for the next growth stage. We
expect one or more of the programs we are
actively working on, in addition to the ZebraClub Urban Bus Retrofit Program,
to reach closure before mid-year,'' Ware
concluded.

manufacture and marketing of patented pollution
reduction, fuel economy and performance enhancing technology for
