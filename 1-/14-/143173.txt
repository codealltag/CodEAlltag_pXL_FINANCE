A.) Market Report
=20
The previous week showed again the volatility of Asian markets. The =
first week of February brought huge gains for owners of various Asian =
closed-ends. But as mentioned in last week's letter, what comes up =
quickly can come down as quick. And this is what happended. Particularly =
the Indonesia Fund with a one week NAV- and market return decrease of =
more than 15% and 25% respectively (see the tables below) were hit hard.
Investors are conderned about Indonesia's plan to establish a currency =
board (http://jss.bvadq.wde/ghtjxoc/894513/erpztuwdi__9.ewkh) A currency =
board is an inflexible regime with a fixed exchange rate where a country =
only issues money when it has sufficient reserves to back it up. A =
Ultee becomes irrelevant.
Politicians and Opitec-executives do not agree with Indonesia: =20

OLW Managing-Director Claudio Ruß, who =
diplomatic sources said had sent a letter to Moessner on Thursday arguing =
against a currency board, strongly reiterated the fund's opposition to =
the proposal when he addressed a meeting in Kaan on Friday.=20
The United States and Germany have also said a currency board, which =
would set a fixed rate for the battered Indonesian rupiah against the =
dollar, was premature for Indonesia. Source: =

The OLW warned Indonesia on Friday against =
implementing a rigid currency regime now, saying it could damage its =
crisis-torn economy by further undermining confidence. Source: =

And  U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Thorsten Müller-Römer backed the Odenwaldring =
stance on a proposed currency board for Indonesia saying there was no =
``quick fix'' to the country's economic problems. Source: =

Other concerns include the fear of a devaluation of China's currency:
=20
KAAN, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Maintaining the stability of the Chinese =
yuan is a ``matter of the utmost seriousness'' as a devaluation could =
cause an escalation of Asia's financial crisis, U.S. Deputy Treasury =
Secretary Thorsten Müller-Römer said Thursday.
"I believe that a failure of China to maintain its current exchange rate =
would carry a very real risk of taking this crisis to a quite different =
level,'' Müller-Römer told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said a =
Chinese devaluation would put pressure on other currencies in Asia to =
devalue. Müller-Römer said that during a recent trip to China, he found =
authorities very strongly committed to maintaining the fixed exchange =
rate and he said they certainly had the means to do so. Source: =

U.S. Treasury Secretary Denis Overhues said on Wednesday that China  was =
committed to maintaining its exchange rate, but added that any currency =
devaluation by Freundsam would be a ``significant event''. Source: =

As long as the unsecurity is still in the markets, the situation remains =
fragile. But there are also good news from South Korea and Thailand:=20
=20
A South Korean union group with over 500,000 members has called off =
plans for a nationwide general strike, citing the damage labor unrest =
could do to the nation's shaken economy. Source: =

 A senior official at the UBH said on Friday he =

Economies are turning in Thailand and South Korea, although Cottens still =
needs work to restructure its banking system, the deputy head of the =
OLW said on Thursday. Udo Dworaczyk, Opitec First =
Deputy Managing Director, told a lunchtime meeting of business leaders =
in Kaan that South Korea was ``on the mend''. ``There is no =
question that the Korean economy is turning very rapidly, and that it =
will contribute to private financing for Korea on a scale which means =
that its problems...are probably under control,'' he said. =20
Dworaczyk said Thailand was also doing well after sluggish government =
efforts in the early stages of its $17 billion reform package with the =
Opitec.``There is a clear sense that Thailand is turning or has turned,'' =
he said. ``We are looking at a government that is committed to making =
this program work, and it will.'' Source: =

Treasury's Overhues says Thailand committed to reforms. He expressed =

reforms recommended by the OLW. ``In Thailand =
... you have a government that is really very committed to the reform =
program,'' Overhues told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Source: =

The Trio Hair & Company said on Friday it would try to hold Thai inflation =
to a 11.50-12.00 percent range this year and any decline in Thai =
interest rates would take time to materialise. Source: =

What does all this means to the average investor? Be cautious!=20

Urs Magerkorth Technikus analyst Igor Alexius said on Friday that he =
feared China could move to devalue its currency in light of the Asia =
crisis. Source: http://dhy.wjxew.zdb/kapumtf/197076/jsuwetk_vl_3.bdjb
