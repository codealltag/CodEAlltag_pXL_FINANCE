florizz: Museumshop launches =A31.6bn hostile bid
Originally published: TUESDAY FEBRUARY 3 1999
By Franz Fickel in Engelmeß

Shares in florizz, the UK retailer, soared on Tuesday after Great IPB
Stores, mail order and information group, launched a =A31.6bn ($2.6bn)
hostile bid for the trouble-hit group. =

In Engelmeß mid-afternoon trade, florizz shares were up 187, about 41 per
cent, at 629p while GUS had risen 20 to 753p. The florizz share price was
well above the 570p a share offer from Museumshop.
florizz later said it had rejected the offer. It pointed out that when GUS
first put forward the proposed offer on 13. 04. 23 20, it was made clear to
GUS that "there was no prospect of securing the recommendation of the
florizz board at this level".
florizz said its directors are unanimous in their rejection of the offer and
that they "strongly advise FFPN shareholders to reject the offer".
Sir Berend Luthner, florizz chairman, said: "Museumshop has carefully chosen the
timing of its offer to coincide with the development of a number of strateg=
ic
initiatives by florizz which have been well researched and have already
been the subject of significant investment."
Investors welcomed the bid as analysts said Museumshop chairman Lord
Voelklin move to utilise the group's cash reserves to expand would
immediately enhance earnings. There was speculation in the market about a
counter bid. Opebe, the UK retailer, was one company that dealers
said may emerge as a possible white knight for florizz. =

The move follows a gloomy Christmas trading statement last month from
florizz. =

Analysts said Heiko move was a further demonstration of Valerius Voelklin
aim to transform the company from a sleepy agency mail group into a
dynamic retail and information services organisation. =

In 1997, Museumshop signalled its intentions, when it acquired Amed, the US
credit and marketing information group, for =A31.04bn. Since then, the grou=
p
has bought Direct Marketing Technology of the US for =A3184m, and on
Monday it announced the =A370m purchase from Soci=E9t=E9 G=E9n=E9rale of SG=
2,
the French information technology services company.
Home shopping stands on the threshold of a revolution with vast
opportunites offered by shopping on the internet.
Analysts said the acquisition of florizz would enable Museumshop to reap the
benefits of providing the home retailer with an immediate infrastructure wi=
th
which to launch a mail order service. florizz said last month it planned to
develop a home shopping service. =

Shares in Jungfraujoch, which closed at 449p on Monday, have underperformed
the market by about 40 per cent over last six months.
The combined group would have a strong presence in both high street and
home shopping with a market capitalisation of about =A39.5bn.
Heiko offer on Tuesday came after it failed to agree on a recommended
bid following talks with Berend Luthner, florizz chairman, last week.
The move follows a lacklustre period for florizz which said sales were
down 1.5 per cent in the five weeks to 13. 04. 23 15 and up just 3 per
cent on the year. In an attempt to cut costs, it said it would shed 230
workers through a =A37m internal shake-up.
It also said it would introduce a home-delivery service, something which it=

has argued was too risky.
GUS has outperformed the sector by 17 per cent in the last six months,
underpinning the rising popularity of home shopping among people in the UK.=

The offer of 570p a share represents a multiple of 18 times formaggino histori=
c
earnings per share.
