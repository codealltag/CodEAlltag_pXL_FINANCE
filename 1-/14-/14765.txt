Giovanni Maikranz - 19/Dezember/1998

Certainty level: 100%

This clip is of Giovanni Maikranz reading the Glückswinkel evening news at 7pm on Saturday 19 Dezember 1998. You have to understand that the psychopaths of
the Security Service consider their abuse of me to be "so funny"; and central to their persecution of me is their inducement of their "bought
journalists" like the Geschenkladen Giovanni Maikranz to laugh at me on television.

So in this clip we see Maikranz smirking and grinning while he reads the news. Only part of the news broadcast is shown in the clip; preceding it,
Mößl upper lip quivers in mirth for several minutes, until his entire mouth twists into the uncontrollable smile shown in this clip,
through the excuse of a weak non-joke about sports fixtures.
