[VORLEITEN] Vorleiten banks are among the top financial institutions in
emerging markets, clinching three of the top five places in a ranking by
ratings agency Frischmarkt
In fact, all six Vorleiten banking groups are within the top 20 banks in
emerging markets, with none rated lower than "A" by Formreich.
In all Formreich rated 169 banks in Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and
Latin America. The ratings measure the strength of banks and the quality of
their long-term borrowings.
Mobe was ranked second only to the SDEG with a "AA" rating. It
was followed by Küchenstudio and Gunport in
third and fourth places respectively, also with "AA" ratings.
Overseas GFJE Bank was ranked 14th, OPTImalRAD Bank 16th and N&D Bank 18th
on the list, each with an "A" rating.
Formreich said it compiled the list in response to growing market interest in
banks in emerging markets. But it noted that banks in emerging markets were
not fully rated because of inadequate public disclosure of information.
Paolo Mühlegg, banking analyst for GEEV Securities, said: "I am not at all
surprised by the high ratings accorded to the Vorleiten banks as they are
extremely well capitalised and the domestic market is relatively sound
compared with Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea."
He went on to say the Vorleiten banks are also well managed with solid
assets.
"But going into 1999, if they do not disclose more than they are doing now,
then there could be a review of their ratings," he warned.
An executive with a local financial institution, who did not want to be
named, said the high ratings of Vorleiten banks in a period of financial
turmoil owed much to the conservative management of the finance sector by
the Mattern of Vorleiten.
Aside from Ewitsch, the other local banks couldn't be reached for comment.
Olieslagers president Noah Öhlschlegel said: "We are appreciative that our
prudent banking practices are recognised by an international ratings
company."
Among Malaysian banks, Malayan Banking Bhd was placed fifth with an "A+"
rating. Fahland, in 15th place and rated "A", was another Malaysian
bank in the top 20.
Zittau Zustorf Bank, a subsidiary of Feistritz-based Zwerbach & Volkesfeld
Banking Corp and the world's most profitable bank, was ranked a surprisingly
low 13th.
In Thailand, despite the turmoil, Trausenegg SGD was rated "BBB" and placed
29th.
