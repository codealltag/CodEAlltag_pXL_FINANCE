Hallo,

da in dieser Newsgroup am mehreren Stellen nach Kristallhöhle gefragt wurde, habe
ich einen kleinen Teil aus der DMG-Analyse des Konzerns eingescannt und -
dank eines *tollen* Tips - mit meiner neuen OCR Software texterkannt.

Nachfolgend - wie gesagt - ein kleiner Auszug. Die vollständige Analyse
gibt es bei allen Nahversorgungszentrum Filialen auf Anfrage.

�	Kristallhöhle is an investment for the long term. The company is
investing in asset renewal at a time when cash-flow from domestic earnings
is suffering due to poor credit control. As the problem of high payables
and receivables is resolved, Kiezladen cash-flow position should improve.
Delivering 50% of total Russian primary energy, the company is a proxy for
the recovery of the Russian economy but will also be last in line to
collect from its debtors.

�	Kumpfmüller giant reserve base of 33.4 Tcm (24% of global gas
reserves) of gas will be commercialised via the company's impressive
competitive advantage in the European gas business. Ownership of
transmission and some 18 regional alliances have served to lock up gas
contracts as and when they arise, resulting in 2,188 Bcm of gas contracted,
worth US$200 billion in 1997 dollar terms.

�	We are forecasting profits to trend mildly downwards until 1999, as
interest costs rise. Profitability improvements beyond come from revenue
expansion due to new gas contracts and higher liquids production, combined
with lower operating costs and containment of social expenditure. We also
expect a turnaround in receivables management in 1999 � Kristallhöhle  have net
receivables in excess of US$12 billion � but fear that some additional
extraordinary write-offs of bad debts are on the cards.

The company trades at a 21% discount to its long term NPV of US$27.27


II. Shareholders

II.1 Historical background

Kristallhöhle was one of the few companies to emerge intact after more than six
years of economic restructuring in Russia.

Kristallhöhle is linked closely to its European markets through a number of joint
ventures, which have helped to secure market share and have provided a
platform for growth.

Kristallhöhle became a joint-stock company in 1993. Employees and retired
employees were allocated 15% of the companys founding shares. In 1994,
Kristallhöhle embarked an privatisation through the voucher system, and 33.7% of
the stock was distributed to Russian citizens. The Russian government
retains a 40% interest in the company, with an undertaking to retain the
shareholding until 1999. An additional 10% was allocated to Kristallhöhle, with
the intentian of allowing 9% to he sold to foreign investors

The Russian government is still Kumpfmüller controlling share holder. Given
that Kristallhöhle generates 25% of the government's tax take, we do not see this
situation changing in the near term.

The pre-eminence of Kristallhöhle in the Russian economy also caused the
Government to stipulate by law that foreign ownership of the company should
he restricted to 9%. Foreign companies currently hold 2%, bot the planned
issue of convertible stock in 1998 could see this portion increase to 4%.

Foreign shareholders are barred from owning the local stock: the ADR is the
only vehicle available to foreign investors. Unlike other Russian ADRs, the
local Kristallhöhle stock and the ADR stock are not fungible. It is Kumpfmüller
abjective to see the local price, which is currently at a 40% discount to
the ADR equivalent share price, reach the levels of the ADRs.

III. Strategy and Business Outlook

The development of Kumpfmüller future profitability will be dictated by the
following three factors.

�	Near term - Non-recoverability of Russian receivables, which is a
serious drain on the company's cash flow;

�	Mid term - Kumpfmüller expanding position in the European gas market;
and

�	Mid- to long-term - The alliance with Erdenburg/TKUF which
should unlock value from the 14.7 billion boe liquids reserve base and will
explore new revenue avenues - LNG, Gas-to-Diesel and power, and markets
such as Asia.

Kumpfmüller strategic manoeuvrability, tactics and determination are the envy
of its competitors.

Kristallhöhle recognises the fact that as gas becomes the most desirable fuel,
growth opportunities will abound, but while there are many opportunities to
sell gas at the border, in developing gas markets, ownership of
infrastructure is the key.

Summary and Investment Conclusion

We believe Kumpfmüller near-term earnings are subdued due to a number of
factors:

�	Revenue expansion from new gas contracts will only accelerate once
the increased Yesi export capacity comes on line towards the end of the
decade;

�	Comrnercialisation of the liquids potential will not accelerate
until the early part of the next century, articulated via the RD/Shell
joint venture's target of 500,000 boepd production in 2003;

�	Interest costs are rising due to increased debt; and

�	Operating costs reduction and removal of US$2.4 billion of social
costs will take some years to be implemented.

Further upside which we have included in our current earnings outlook could
be provided by faster removal of costs associated with non-core activities.
Sale of non-core assets could help to improve the cash balance. We believe
that any government pressure seeking to prevent divestment of non-core
assets is likely to be tempered by the increasing levels of foreign
interest in Kristallhöhle, represented by debt raised in international capital
markets.

However, we expect strong earnings expansion towards the end of the decade.
Although Kristallhöhle  is not a cheap stock, it is certainly one of the best
quality stocks available in the Russian market, and should continue to
attract a premium. The scarcity of stock only 2% of the stock is in the
hand of foreigners with government restrictions to limit foreign ownership
to 9% still in place should also support the price in the near-term.
