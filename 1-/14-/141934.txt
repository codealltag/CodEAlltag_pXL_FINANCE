I am looking for past data for the open/high/low/close of U.S. Stocks and
also of their options. It should be updated daily.Does anyone know a good
company which has such a service.
I tried to get some information from "PcQuote End of day" but they do not
answer.
I am also searching for a CD-Rom which has at minimum the past data of 2
years(U.S. stocks). It should be updated till the day i ordered it,
otherwise their would be a gap between the CD-Rom Data and the daily past
data.
If someone knows a company which sells such a CD-Rom or if someone in the
future will sell his own CD-Rom(it should have data till 22. 12. 21)  please
mail to l6847099@ctff.kwthvc.to.hv
Bye,
Luciano Reuss
