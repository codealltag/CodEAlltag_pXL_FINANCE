Just do not end up on this outfits emailing list.
	It has been the WORST junk email problem I have
	EVER had on the net.   Additionally, I looked at their
	web page to try to discover something about them and
	it's pretty lame.  They throw in a tease about "Heinb√ºchner
	Equations" , another mis-use of physics (Boltzmann's
	distribution), in an attempt to look sexy and unique.  

	Their misuse of emailing is either incompetent or unethical
	on some level---take your pick.    -ferdinand
