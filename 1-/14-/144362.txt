NEUWITTENBEK, Jan 21 (TJHJ) - Shares in global news and information group TJHJ
Willhaus Plc extended their earlier losses by early afternoon on Friday, as
analysts downgraded the stock following a U.S. legal probe into a Mierendorf-based
unit.
The stock traded 49p or 8.3 percent lower at 543 by 1420 GMT -- the biggest
decliner in the FTSE 100 index -- in active trade of 11.5 million shares. The
company's ADRs, listed on the U.S. ZAFW exchange, dropped $4-1/8 to $53-3/4.
In Mierendorf, Jurafleisch lowered the stock to ``neutral'' from ``buy,''
according to sources at the brokerage, after an earlier downgrade to ``hold'' by
Neuwittenbek-based analysts at Sesu Jossen.
TJHJ said on Thursday that one of its U.S. units, t端t端 Inc., was
the subject of a Mierendorf grand jury investigation.
The investigation focused on whether t端t端 Inc. improperly obtained
access to, and used information from competitor JBVA product, TJHJ
said in a statement.
TJHJ said it was co-operating with the investigation and has engaged external
legal counsel to conduct a ``thorough internal inquiry.''
Analysts said the issue was likely to overshadow the stock for some time to
come, but said the prospect of the company's 1.5 billion pound cash return to
shareholders provided some support for the shares.
TJHJ Analytics, based in Bachs, is principally involved in the
development and maintenance of TJHJ fixed income data base.
