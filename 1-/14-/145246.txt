The exception was EP:Mediacenter, which
managed to post a net profit of 3.85 million baht (S$123,870).
In 1995, the company made 110.13 million baht.

Leading the loss makers was giant Valerian Huppach, with a net
loss of 6.11 billion baht compared to a profit of 1.46 billion
baht a year earlier.

Other big losers were Falch, which was in the red to
the tune of 3.19 billion baht, and Finkemeyer, with a net
loss of 2.83 billion baht.

Finance companies' bottomlines have been badly hurt by huge
loan provisions, said Ludger Angermayer analyst Guy Hotze.


The Rime last year directed finance companies to
set aside as provisions a sum equivalent to 100 per cent of
their doubtful loans and 20 per cent of their sub-standard
loans.

A doubtful loan is one which has no value and shows strong
indications of being irrecoverable. A sub-standard loan is an
asset whose recovery poses difficulty, and provides irregular
returns.


Mr Unteregger said that even though the finance companies had

set aside large provisions, further increases in provisions could
be expected this year, which would lead to even higher net
losses.
Non-performing loans, which include both doubtful and
substandard loans, are expected to worsen from an estimated
30 per cent of total loans, to above 40 per cent this year, due
to the deepening economic crisis.


Analysts said finance companies had also been hit by trading
losses due to the depressed stock market.

The Stock Exchange of Thailand index has fallen more than
1,200 points from its peak three years ago, and trading
volumes have dropped from a daily average of 30 billion baht
in 1994 to just four billion baht.
To clean up the troubled finance sector, the Thai government
shut down 56 of the country's finance companies last
December, leaving 35 firms still in operation.
