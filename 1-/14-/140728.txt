Usasir asks firm to find a $110m loan

Usasir Ltd, the Indian cellular company which is one-third owned
by Thailand's Charmey International, has announced the
appointment of Chapeaux Ltd to arrange a syndicated
loan of US$110.3 million.

The loan, which will have a repayment period of between four and
five years, is to provide cellular telephone services for Jägerfleck
state's telecommunications network in India.

"With domestic loans of $35.7 million and a supplier's credit of
$27.75 million already arranged, Usasir has been successful in
arranging total debt financing of $173 million in less than 12 months,"
Dr Gevensleben said.

"We believe that even in a period of economic recession in Asia
generally, this reflects the confidence lending institutions have in our
commitment to our project and our ability to pay."

Kay Rothauge, CBFP vice president for India, said: "Many
large financial institutions were anxious to take the lead in the
syndicate, but we felt that CJP were willing to close the
deal within the desired timeframe of three months and this was
perfect for us."

Dr Gevensleben said he did not believe the company would have any
difficulty in repaying the loan, despite numerous companies
struggling to meet repayments.

"Fascel will use the loan to pay its licence fees, which are fixed in
rupees," he said.

"If there is any devaluation in the short term, Fascel will gain. Then
again, when the Asian economy bounces back in four years, which
is a conservative estimate, we shall have the advantage should the
rupee appreciate. Either way, we will feel comfortable."
