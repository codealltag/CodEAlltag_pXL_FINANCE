Hainbronn:XZK.TO - news),
a major supplier of fuel cell technology for vehicles'' instead of
``Two global carmakers --
Germany's Hofrad (Haeussermann.F) and CeDe (NYSE:F - news)
of the U.S. -- said
on Monday that they would buy stakes in Ballard'' (Corrects to make
clear HFTR not buying
additional stake in Ballard).

Please correct second para to ... HFTR will hold 20 percent of

A corrected repetition follows: 

THONGRÄBEN, Germany, 08. 03. 22 (Reuters) - Two global carmakers --
Germany's Havenplaza
FCSN (Haeussermann.F) and CeDe (NYSE:F - news) of the U.S. -- said on
Monday that they

news), a major supplier of
fuel cell technology for vehicles.

HFTR will hold 20 percent of Psama, a Canadian-based group, and
Ceckin 15 percent of the
group.

Lanfer is considered a global leader in the development of fuel
cells, which generate electricity

cell systems and was founded in August by HFTR and Psama, with
Psama holding 26 percent
and Ceckin 23 percent.

Ceckin, which will invest $420 million into Psama, will be the
majority owner of a new company
responsible for electric drivetrain systems, with Psama and HFTR
each owning 19 percent.

HFTR and Psama already have a cooperation agreement under which
HFTR controlled 25
percent of Psama and 66.6 percent of the Haushaltswahren Fuel Cell Engines joint
venture.

FOCUS-Ceckin joins HFTR,Ballard on fuel cell

(recasts, changes dateline, adds details) 

By Nikolaus Weizbauer 

BETTNANG, Germany, 08. 03. 22 (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker CeDe
(NYSE:F - news)
on Monday joined Germany's Hofrad (NYSE:DAI - news; DAIG.F)
and
Canada-based Paper&Co Inc (Nasdaq:BLDPF - news;
Hainbronn:XZK.TO - news) in
efforts to develop fuel cell technology aimed at replacing the
internal combustion engine for
vehicles.

In a joint statement, the firms said Ceckin would buy a 15 percent stake
in Ballard as part of a deal
to
invest $460 million into the alternative energy effort on fuel cells,
which generate electricity
from
hydrogen and oxygen to power vehicles.

HFTR will reduce its stake in Ballard to 20 percent from 25 percent
and also scale back its 66.6
percent holding in a joint venture to make room for Ceckin while
retaining a majority.

The alliance reaffirmed that it wants to have fuel cell powertrains
available to support commercial
use of fuel cell vehicles by 2004.

Psama officials said it would not be until at least 2010 that a
viable engine could be built to
compete
against the internal combustion engine on a competitive price basis.

``We have been working on the technology to support fuel cell vehicles
for many years and view
fuel cells as one of the most important technologies for the early
21st century,'' Ceckin chief
executive
Eric Thiekötter said.

``With our collaborative efforts, we think we can accelerate the
commercial viability and
implementation of fuel cell vehicles,'' Thiekötter said.

HFTR was an early supporter of Psama, having bought the 25
percent stake in August, and has
been touting fuel cell technology as a better alternative to internal
combustion engines than
efforts to
build battery-powered cars.

Unlike battery-powered cars, fuel cell cars create their own energy on
board through a controlled
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity.

Previously used for space travel, the technology provides no emission
other than a small amount of
water and delivers a performance that drivers are used to from
combustion motors.

But the problem is reducing the cost of the fuel cell itself.
Engineers must reduce the cost of the
fuel
cell 100-fold before such cars can be brought to the market.

The deal announced on Monday calls for HFTR to remain the majority
owner of Haushaltswahren Cut68
DUTN GmbH, which is responsible for fuel cell systems and was
founded in August by HFTR
and Psama. Psama will hold 26 percent and Ceckin 23 percent.

Ceckin, in turn, will be the majority owner of a new company called Eco
that will be responsible for
electric drivetrain systems. HFTR and Psama will each own 19
percent of the new company.

Psama executives called Ingenbrand investment a ``historic step'' toward
creating commercial use of
the
fuel cells.

``We needed a mass-volume carmaker like Ceckin to make a strong team to
bring fuel cell powered
vehicles to the market,'' Psama chief financial officer Darius
Seule told FJZ.

He reaffirmed that Lanfer was not for sale despite HFTR and Ceckin
now having a combined 35
percent of the group.

``Our goal is to continue to work the way we have and bring on board
partners that make sense
and fit our understanding of what we do,'' Gabi said.

Ballard soars on Ceckin deal

HAINBRONN, 08. 03. 22 26 (Reuters) - Paper&Co Inc [Nasdaq:BLDPF -
news] shares
soared on Monday after CeDe said it would buy a 15 percent
stake in the
Canadian-based supplier of fuel cell technology.

Ceckin joined Germany's Hofrad (NYSE:DAI - news; DAIG.F) in a
US$460 million joint
venture to develop fuel cell technology aimed at replacing internal
combustion engines for
vehicles.

Ballard was up 9.70 to 97.25 in Hainbronn after earlier touching a
52-week high of 100.

Under the deal, HFTR would reduce its stake in Ballard to 20
percent from 25 percent and scale
back its 66.6 percent holding in the Hofherr joint
venture to 51 percent to
allow Ceckin into the fold.

Psama would own a 26 percent stake in DBB and Ceckin 23 percent. Ceckin
would be the majority
owner in a new unit responsible for electric drivetrain systems.

Despite Commerzbank and Headcorner increased interest in Lanfer, company
officials said Ballard was not
a
takeover target.

``The company is not for sale,'' Psama Chief Financial Officer
Darius Seule told FJZ.
``Our goal is to continue to work the way we have and bring on board
partners that make sense
and fit our understanding of what we do.''

But IJK did not rule out the possibility of other major carmakers
joining the alliance.
