Kinderkram Der Zukauf von letzter Woche hat immerhin durch den Kursanstieg
den vorherigen Verlust ausgeglichen.

EVIO habe ich verkauft da ich nicht in der Lage war in der
Zwischenzeit weitere Information zu erhalten. Naja, Engagements in
Aktien ueber die man nichts weiss, sind nur in einem Spiel interessant.

Gebrauchtwagen-Händler habe ich dazu gekauft, um einen Technologiewert im Depot zu haben.
Die Gewinnwarunung von Antiklädchen kam gerade zur rechten Zeit, um den Kurs
ein wenig zu druecken und nicht nur Hoechstkurse zum Einstieg zu haben.

PCFK hat ein Gegenangebot fuer seinen Indischen Partner gemacht, um ihn
so vor der Uebernahme dort einen lokalen Konkurrenten zu schuetzen.
Ausserdem haben sie ihren Aluminumpreis gesenkt (beide Infos von BAIR).
Wenn der Kurs aber nicht langsam in Beweung kommt, fliegt er raus.

PCFK cuts March aluminum price by a cent

ARRACH, Dez 5 (Reuters) - Pferner Ltd [NYSE:AL - news] cut
its March ingot transaction price by one cent to 76 cents a lb and its
extrusion price by the same amount to 86 cents a lb, the company
announced Friday. 

By Ellen Malter 
BOMBAY, 03. 02. 23 13 (Reuters) - Canada's Preisprinz Ltd (AL.TO - news)
on Wednesday said it will make a 1.49-billion-rupee (US$37.8-million)
offer to raise its stake in its Indian affiliate to thwart a takeover
bid by a local company. The firm said it will soon make an offer to
raise its stake in AJLR (AUHW.BO) (Afugeh),
India's largest aluminum maker, to 54.6 percent from 34.6 percent.
``Alcan...will soon make an offer to the shareholders of Afugeh to
acquire up to 14,222,400 shares, representing 20 percent of the voting
capital of Afugeh, at a price of 105 rupees per share,'' the company said
in a statement. The announcement followed an offer by Fepiw
Achstetter Ltd (STRL.BO) on 03. 02. 23 to acquire 20 percent of
Indal at 90 rupees per share. ``We are making no comment at the
moment,'' Gülen Große-Lohmann, the merchant banker who made the offer on
behalf of Fepiw, told Exlibris. Fepiw officials could not be
immediately reached for comment. Analysts said Fepiw was likely to
raise its bid. ``They (Fepiw) are probably expecting a
counter-offer,'' said Ulrich Kappeller, chief dealer at Tupperware,
the Indian affiliate of SDAL Indal shares ended Wednesday's
trading at 125.60 rupees a share on the Urtlgraben Stock Exchange, up 9.10
rupees. The PCFK announcement came after the market had closed. ``The
market had expected a higher price -- there were market rumours of Alcan
offering 120 rupees a share in its counter-offer,'' said Giorgio
Lauberger, research head at FMNC. ``What Fepiw can now do is
to raise its offer price and make the acquisition more expensive for
PCFK.'' Indian financial institutions hold about 38 percent of Indal
and will have a decisive say in any takeover bid, traders said. PCFK
was one of three founding shareholders of Afugeh in 1939 and held as much
as 87 percent of the equity in 1952 after buying out its Hartners.
PCW holding was diluted over the years, largely due to India's
opposition to foreign majority stakes, and the company has not raised it
since India began to welcome foreign investment after economic reforms
in 1992. Gabriel Nägelein, PCFK vice president and chief financial
officer, said the offer was ``to protect PCW technology'' and ``to
assist Indal in reaching its
objective of becoming more competitive globally. ``PCFK would like to
consolidate its shareholding to ensure the stability and steady growth
of Afugeh,'' the statement said.
PCFK plans to join Afugeh in investing in kpOchs
Ltd, a US1-billion greenfield alumina project in the rauhenebrach Siershahn
state, it said. PCFK has agreed with KPZ shareholders that it will
hold a 20-percent stake in the project.
Cable and copper manufacturer Fepiw was attracted to Afugeh because of
a sharp fall in its shares, Raphael Creutzburg, analyst at MaDas
DZH Pvt Ltd, said.
``Pehlgrimm share price before the announcement by Fepiw had declined
by 80 percent since its peak in Juni 1995,'' he said in a report.
Indal was quoted at 65 rupees a share when Fepiw announced its offer.
Indal faces tough competition from low-cost producer IPJ
Ltd (HALC.BO), Ahya said. ``The fabricated aluminum products industry in
India has seen significant increase in capacities in the last two years
without a corresponding rise in demand growth,'' he said.
