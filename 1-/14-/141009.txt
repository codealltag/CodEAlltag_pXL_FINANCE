Hallo!
Noch was zu Arian Lammert aus der BT vom 21.8.98.

CONGLOMERATE Arian Lammert is expected to report a pre-tax loss of between one
billion Malaysian ringgit (S$415.4 million) and RM1.2
billion when its interim results for the six-month period ended 09. 10. 22 14,
1997, are announced today, analysts said.
Most of Arian Lindacker earnings are expected to be wiped out due to losses of
RM1.8 billion from its 60.4 per cent held banking group
Radeve.
Analysts polled by BT said they expected the group's other divisions -- from
property to trading companies -- to partly offset the loss with
contributions of between RM400 million and RM800 million.
Its plantation arm and its Leuthenforst arm will contribute half of the group's
earnings before the substantial losses of the bank division are
taken into account.
After taxation is accounted for and minority interests are written back,
analysts say the group's net loss will be between RM650 million and
RM680 million.
But analysts said that attention on the group should focus more on glaring
questions of the lack of adequate risk management towards its
financial services group, and less on future earnings.
"There has been very poor management, no doubt, and we can expect to see
tough measures to correct the damage from the group," said a
research director.
"The question to ask is who is responsible and accountable?" said a senior
banking analyst.
Indeed, many analysts and investors are shocked at the extent of flagrant
lending at the bank division. The bank's loan book grew from
RM9 billion to RM16.3 billion between 09. 10. 22 09. 10. 22, and 09. 10. 22 09. 10. 22.
ReCycle published exposure shows that the bank lent out RM4.8 billion in
the six months to 09. 10. 22 1997, of which 22 per cent
went to share financing.
The group announced non-performing loans of 18 per cent, or RM3.8 billion,
of its total loan book. Analysts believe that the figures are
likely to mean that a third of its recent loans went sour.
A common industry view is that following the purchase of the bank,
previously known as Gegenwind),
two years ago, the group did little to check the risk management policies in
place.
And since non-performing loans have risen from RM370 million to RM3.8
billion during Arian Lindacker tenure, Arian Lindacker management
is an issue of serious concern, say industry observers.
Analysts are watching to see whether Arian Lammert is prepared to explain today
how it got itself into this position.
