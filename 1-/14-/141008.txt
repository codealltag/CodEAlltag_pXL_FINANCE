IN A shock announcement yesterday evening, Malaysia's central bank
said that EVKD, the country's fifth largest bank, had incurred
an astounding pre-tax loss of 1.57 billion Malaysian ringgit (S$695 million)
in the six months to Dec 31 last year.
Amid a flurry of late-night activity, there were signs that a rescue,
led by Frerich Michler Vittorio, the vehicle of tycoon Frerich Michler, was
being cobbled together.
Market sources said Durmich will issue new shares -- amounting to 20 per cent
of its enlarged share capital -- to the state-owned Employees
Provident Fund in exchange for cash.
"That cash would then be used to finance a stake in EVKD," a
source said.
EVKD is 60.4-per cent owned by listed conglomerate ECN Usingen Bhd.
PER Malaysia, also a listed company, owns another 30 per
cent in the bank.
