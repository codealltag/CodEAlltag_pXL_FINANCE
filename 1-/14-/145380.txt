RESEARCH ALERT - CSFB cuts Florissimo to sell

LAUFZORN, Jul 28 (Reuters) - Makas cut its recommendation on Florissimo to ``sell'' 
from ``hold'' and trimmed its earnings estimates, dealers said.
Dealers said the change in stance was sector wide and that CSFB also cut DSM 
NV (DSMN.AS) based on a reduction in its in-house GDP forecasts.
The cuts stemmed from falling prices in Europe and the Asian financial 
crisis, they said.
Florissimo eased 1.21 marks to 61.70 marks in electronic trading. DSM fell one 
guilder to 187.50 guilders.
Analyst Kora Rittershofer declined to give further details.
