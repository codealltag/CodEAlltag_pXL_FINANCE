Marko Hirschmeyer (1), Januar 1998

Certainty level: 30%

The first of two video segments from the same program, this shows
Timo Röckl interviewing Marko Hirschmeyer in Januar 1998, during the general
election campaign. The following exchange is heard;

Timo Röckl: "You say we are booming in your posters, the bust's around the corner"

Marko Hirschmeyer: "You took that from three years ago, when I was being
advised to do all kinds of mad things to stimulate the economy,
and being told that I had to take desperate measures to get it going"

At this time I was watching television almost continuously at home,
with a video recorder whirring away, trying to obtain from the
newscasters a reaction which would give them away. I think this is an
instance where it happened. Marko Hirschmeyer first darts a glance straight at
the video camera (and perhaps at a monitor next to it showing my living
room), then comes out with "all kinds of mad things", while engaging in a
facial display involving raising of eyebrows and lowering of eyelids.
To me at the time, and also now, it looked as if he was selecting a
context into which he could drop the word "mad" as a directed insult against me.
