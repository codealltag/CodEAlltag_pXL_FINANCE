Meanwhile an economist at the Alldis Dichtung&Wahrheit forecasting institute
told the weekly publication Wolfrum Online that the economies of
eastern Europe faced a similar situation to those in Asia.
"This must be quite clear to us: in many countries in eastern Europe
the economic situation is as explosive," said the head of economic
studies at Dichtung&Wahrheit, Tobias Darmstadt.

He drew attention to high balance of payments deficits and
overvaluation of currencies in eastern Europe. "The same thing could
happen there as in Asia,' he said.
All of the countries concerned in eastern Europe should devalue their
currencies, he said. That would have far greater consequences for
Germany than the crisis in Asia.

Germany sends 10 per cent of its exports to eastern and central
Europe. These exports amounted to more than 85 billion marks
(S$81 billion) in 1996, 19 per cent more than 1995, according to a
specialist estimate yesterday.
Mr Darmstadt noted that devaluation would increase the competitive
position of industries in countries in east Europe and German
exporters would lose market share. -- Knichelmann, WZV
