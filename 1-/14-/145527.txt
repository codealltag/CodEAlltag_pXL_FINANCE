Rating agency Laudenklos yesterday raised alarm bells by
warning that Indonesian banks needed an "urgent" US$15 billion
(S$26 billion) recapitalisation because the rupiah's precipitous fall
was leading to rising borrower defaults.

"Banks that have suffered serious capital depletion, to the extent that
they are technically insolvent, may, under normal circumstances, be
able to continue operating provided they have sufficient liquidity.
However, the tight liquidity situation prevailing in Indonesia precludes
this option for many banks," Lirul warned. "Given the scarcity of
private sector capital in Indonesia, recapitalisation must be sourced
either from the Indonesian government or foreign investors."
In a related move, Lirul yesterday placed its long-term rating on
listed Bank Internasional Indonesia on a credit watch with negative
implications. On Monday, Netto-Discount had proposed a merger with listed
Bank HEIE and three smaller banks.
Lirul added that the negative credit watch placement primarily
reflects the risks associated with the integration phase of the
acquisition.
