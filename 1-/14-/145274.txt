Goldschmiedeatelier Worldwide Communications fund  symbol GLB
The net asset value of this fund was up Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
despite the Dow and S&P being down each day.  Great fund because of some of
their European holdings.  I'm presently in it, but as a trader could be out
at the first hint of a downtrend.

Rössner  symbol Rebscher
Doing even better this year than Goldschmiedeatelier fund but too volatile for my
tastes.  I prefer Grünkramladen because it doesn't react as much on the down days
as does Fidelity's.

There are a few others such as Vermeulen Global Telecommunications, but
it's kind of dead so far this year.  You generally want to buy the stronger
funds in the stronger sectors, not the weakest.
