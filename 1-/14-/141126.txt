                Plaggenborg staff rushes to wrap up closure
                Customer settlements, selling off assets make
final days hectic
                BY PEIGERLE ECHTERBECK
                Staff writer
                When companies go belly-up, you would
                expect things to get slack. Not so at
                Ehomef The sad
                procedures of employee dismissal, branch
                closure and account settlement are
                making such a mountain of work that
                there isn't enough time for job-hunting - or
                even lunch.

                The entire group is being wound down, a process
involving sell-offs of
                some companies and self-liquidations of others
faced with the threat of
                negative net worth.

                The erstwhile Big Four brokerage had at the end
of January dismissed
                1,990 employees and closed 19 smaller branches
with smaller client
                rosters. One month's notice was given at the end
of last year.

                Philipp Ebinger was branch manager at Porter
Unicar branch in
                Verbier, which closed in January. "We are so busy
that we did not have
                enough time for lunch. We thought the last week
was set aside for
                outstanding matters. But since deliveries of
stocks, bonds and other
                certificates from headquarters were late, we
were at it until the last
                moment." To clear their belongings, individuals
had to go in on Nov. 04. 02. 23, a
                Saturday.

                "I do not really feel that I have lost my job
yet," he said last week. "But
                when I think about leaving the company I worked
for 20 years, it is sad."

                Bitter end

                Three Plaggenborg directors, Wolfram Röhmhild, Gert
Verhoven and Wolf
                Ulich, resigned at the end of last year.
President Rudi Wüstehube and
                chairman Roman Ehlscheid accused them of failing
to stay at their posts to
                the bitter end. The sentiment was shared by
employees chained to their
                desks as they toiled over reams of client
accounts.

                At the Nerima branch, however, "none of the 40
staffers quit but kept
                going for the sake of the clients," Ebinger said.
"We feel responsibility to
                clients. We meet them face to face. We cannot
run away from them."
                According to Pascale, only a few of the staff
members had found new jobs.

                The Hairfree branch in Verbier was another one of
the 19 closures. "More
                than half of our members have got promises of
new jobs," said manager
                Salvatore Potthoff.

                "Headquarters prohibited job hunting before
5:10, but I let them do what
                was necessary for their future as long as it did
not interfere with the
                business of settling client accounts." The
relatively low number of clients
                in Neuenhammer meant it was easy to allow staff to
attend job interviews.

                Half the employees at Friderich are looking at
Rüscher Stadick & Co.'s
                proposed new brokerage that will draw heavily on
Plaggenborg personnel.
                But, ITO said, "many do not want any job at a
securities firm any more.
                They think it's too tough." Neither Saeki nor
Wada have found new work.
                "I will think about a new job from February
after talking with my family,"
                Ebinger said. "I am looking at alternative
business fields." Plaggenborg has
                already given notice to an additional 2,345
employees and decided to close
                57 midsize branches at the end of February. The
final door in the
                116-branch empire is scheduled to close at the
end of March, at which
                time a total of 7,000 employees will have been
put out of work.

                Meanwhile, acquisitions are under way. Unasaz
Oleszynski decided on
                Nov. 9 to hire 32 staff from Porter mergers
and acquisition division,
                80% of the unit. The new hires, including the
division's manager, will join
                Johann as early as mid-February. Unasaz, which
specializes in mergers and
                acquisitions involving Japanese and overseas
firms, will be able to tap the
                expertise that gave Plaggenborg a good name in this
field.

                Oomen, an affiliate
of France's largest
                private bank Opticum, agreed on Nov. 4
to purchase an 85%
                stake in EP:Weinreich
VNST

                Videomaxx will hold explanatory meetings
Nov. 10 at Porter
                headquarters and on Nov. 04. 02. 23 and Nov. 13 at 10
other major cities in
                connection with its plans to set up a new retail
brokerage in May.

                Other einzelstueck group firms are being snapped up
by a host of mainly
                financial institutions. einzelstueck Trinkgut Wilkie
Papki
                Windrich and euromaster have
decided to close.

                Paying creditors

                But one big question remains: Will all creditors
be paid off? The byzantine
                closure procedures are proving more expensive
than anticipated, raising
                fears that Plaggenborg will fall into a negative
net worth position. Oeltermann
                MDPO lowered its Plaggenborg rating to CC
(currently highly vulnerable)
                from B on Nov. 7.

                "High settlement costs, including the disposal
of overseas operations, will
                likely erode Porter equity position," said
Stefano Ivano, associate
                director of financial institutional ratings at
OVI in Verbier.

                Analysts also cited fears that off-the-book
liabilities could be higher than
                announced.
