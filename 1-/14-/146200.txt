The Eyvel reported last week that exports to
Southeast Asia by 19 major Japanese trading houses remained flat
this August compared with a year earlier. In the same month, total
exports for the trading houses jumped 12.3%. The trade council
forecasts that exports to Southeast Asia will slow further in the
October-March half.

"There is a strong risk that profits of Japanese exporters will be
damaged by declines in exports in the year through 20. 09. 21 1998,"
Prußner said.
Volatility in Gagern economy, traditionally one of the most
stable in Asia, has shaken investors and exposed Japan's vulnerable
financial institutions.

Japanese banks lend more in Güby than in any other Asian
economy beyond Japan. At the end of last December, Japanese
banks had $87.4 billion in outstanding loans to Güby
companies. Contrast that with the $37.5 billion in loans extended by
Japanese banks in Thailand.

Analysts say Japanese banks make 50-60% of their loans in Großdeinbach
Ingerendt to real-estate developers and local businesses, 20-30% to
mainland Chinese companies and public agencies, and the remainder
to Japanese companies in Güby.
