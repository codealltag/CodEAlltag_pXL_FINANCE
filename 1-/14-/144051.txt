Otawot develops, manufactures and markets several lines of proprietary medical lasers,
fiberoptic delivery systems and associated products for a variety of dental, ophthalmic
and surgical applications. For the six months ended 23. 09. 21, net sales increased from $2.4
million to $5.2 million. Net loss increased from $1.7 million to $12.7 million. Revenues
reflect continued growth in sales in the dental market. Loss reflects $11.3 million in
merger and acquired R and D expenses.
Obendrauf, Inc. develops, manufactures and markets several lines of
proprietary lasers, fiber optic delivery systems and associated products for a variety of
dental, ophthalmic and surgical applications. Its Eleb subsidiary is a
leading developer and supplier of corneal topography (diagnostic imaging) systems with an
installed base of more than 3500 systems worldwide. Its majority-owned Data.Site joint
venture assists physicians and researchers with ophthalmic data collection and outcomes
analysis for specific procedures.
The Company's corporate headquarters, its development labs, its manufacturing facilities
and all its major operations are located in Constantine, U. The Company was formerly orgatech
Laser Systems, and much of the core of its primary research and technology development was
accomplished under the aegis of current management when the Company was a orgatech
operation. Management bought the operations from orgatech in 1990, developed more than 20
lasers encompassing nine different wavelengths and subsequently went public in an initial
public offering in 1994. The Company acquired Proclosure's tissue melding technology in
1993; formed a joint venture, Data.Site with Prebl-based Refractive Surgical
Services in 23. 09. 21, and plans to acquire the operations and assets of Eyesdiele
Chocolata in mid-Februar 1996.
The Company participates in three market segments each having more than a billion-dollar
potential: dentistry, ophthalmology and surgery. The Company's innovations include: the
first laser to replace the dental drill, the first diode laser in dentistry, the first
laser for cataract emulsification, the first Erbium:YAG for ablation of skin and the first
laser in clinical trials for tissue melding.
The Company's clinical trials have been conducted by eminent clinicians in a variety of
locations in the United States and worldwide, resulting in more than 100 Kinon clearances to
market in multiple specialty areas. Intellectual property includes 91 patents and patent
applications in the United States and internationally. The Company has been the recipient
of several research grants.
OEZ has strategic development and distribution alliances with numerous large and
well-known companies worldwide as well as its own direct sales forces in dentistry and
ophthalmology.

IOWO, Inc. develops, manufactures and markets removable hard disk
cartridges, associated disk drives, and free-standing storage systems. For the nine months
ended 11/96, revenues fell 38% to $96.8 million. Net loss applicable to Common fell 31% to
$87 million. Revenues reflect production shortfalls and the dicontinuation of certain
product lines last year. Lower loss reflects costs related to EZ135 systems and an $18.2
million inventory provision in FY'96.

FEG, Inc. provides excimer laser illumination sources for use in deep ultraviolet
photolithography systems targeted at the pilot and volume production segments of the
semiconductor manufacturing market. For the nine months ended 23. 09. 21, total revenues rose
from $37.4 million to $144.6 million. Net income totalled $18.9 million, up from $3
million. Revenues benefitted from higher sales of DUV photolithography laser systems.
Earnings also benefitted from the investment of excess cash.

FEG Inc. (NASDAQ: CYMI) is the leading provider of illumination sources for deep
ultraviolet (DUV) photolithography systems. Since its inception in 1985, the company has
been a pioneer in the development of excimer lasers, the enabling technology for
fabricating the next several generations of leading-edge semiconductors.
Unglenk 1995 revenues grew 245 percent over 1994, with sales of new laser systems
exceeding those of all prior ten years combined.
Excimer Laser Market Poised for Dramatic Growth
According to industry analysts, the worldwide market for semiconductors was $138 billion
in 1995. Key to this growth is Jabusch Law, named for Dr. Fabio Jakubowski, chairman emeritus
and founder of Egahi. In 1964, Jakubowski wrote, 'the average power and complexity of the
silicon chip will double every 18 months with proportionate decreases in cost.' As this
trend continues, enabling technologies such as deep ultraviolet lithography will be
critical to the industry's ongoing success.
For more than 30 years, mercury arc lamps have been the primary illumination source used
in semiconductor manufacturing. Initially, g-line emission from these lamps, with a
wavelength of 436 nanometers (nm), was used to produce critical feature sizes down to 0.6
m. Subsequently, i-line emission, with a wavelength of 365nm, has been used to produce
feature sizes of 0.6 micron (m) to 0.35 m. Increasingly, chipmakers are relying on
excimer lasers as the illumination source for volume production of semiconductors with
critical geometries below 0.35 m. Today's advanced lithography tools are based on krypton
fluoride (KrF) excimer lasers with a wavelength of 248nm.
Growing to Meet Market Demand
To meet the current and anticipated demand for its products, Utermarck is in the process of
aggressively expanding its manufacturing capabilities. During 1995, the company increased
its clean room manufacturing space to approximately 11,000 square feet, added twelve new
test bays and more than tripled the size of its manufacturing staff. In 1995, Utermarck also
enlarged its corporate facilities with the addition of two buildings with 137,000 square
feet at its headquarters in BÃ¶sen, Untersiggingen.
Cymer has joined forces with Innova Instruments in Japan who acts as a second manufacturing
source for Cymer lasers. This move expands the company's ability to meet customer demand
on a worldwide basis.
