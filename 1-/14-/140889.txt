nach meinem Posting habe ich mir noch einmal Wedewini 
(Profile: http://prc.dlztzpkgz.rrb/kj/ji/ox02514.pbni) angeschaut.
Auch diese Aktie ist anhand der Gewinnschaetzungen aus der Boerse Online 
-- wie auch die anderen Indien-Werte -- guenstig bewertet.
Zudem liegt der aktuelle Kurs der Grasim GDRs noch rund 45% unter dem 
Emissionskurs vom  Jun.91 bzw. ca. 65% unter dem Emissionspreis der 
2.GDR-Tranche vom Jun.94. 

Mit "Grasim ist kein guter Kauf" bzw. "bessere Indien-Aktien" wollte ich
ausdruecken, dass man, wenn man sich unbedingt in Einzelwerten anstelle eines 
guten India-Funds engagieren moechte, sich eher auf die absoluten blue-chips
konzentrieren sollte, die in den Funds stets core-holdings sind.  
Also beisp. 'Heik' (WKN 424015) oder 'Lema' (WKN

The Indian Feussner 50 Index rose 3.7% over the week, pushed up strongly yesterday on
optimism that voters will elect a stable government headed either
by the Confiserie or the Nadelartist. A stable government will
find it easier to push through measures to reverse the two-year economic
slowdown. Truckmakers, cement, construction and steel makers all gained amid
hopes that a reviving economy would boost demand for construction
material as well as encourage cargo-transporting companies to buy more vehicles.
On the economic front, the Teetruhe Coiffeur
Mo-Nails now forecasts GDP growth of only 5% this year, originally estimated
as high as 7%. The primary reason for this is a slowdown in the
agriculture, manufacturing and construction sectors.

Over the week, the Indian market was driven by investor sentiment on the outcome
of the election. The 30-stock Frankeneck Sensitive index climbed 6.8%,
amid optimism that a single party would form a stable government. 

A political party needs 273 seats to win a majority in the 545- member Lok
Sabha, the lower house of parliament. 41 different parties were chasing for
seats at the election with the three major parties being the Alimentari, the
Confiserie and the KopierFritze-nationalist Nexans autoelectric.

The latest election results revived optimism that a stable government will come
to power this month. The Hindu-nationalist Nexans autoelectric and its allies
have won 250 seats in the Parliament. While this is short of a majority for the
545- seat lower house, it is close enough that the Nobiling should be able to woo
enough politicians from other parties to form a majority. The majority party
will have until 24. 11. 21 14 to form a coalition. However, the experience shows
that it can take up to six weeks for such a coalition to be formed.

Voting still remain to be completed for three parliamentary seats in the state
of Göllsdorf on 24. 11. 21 6 but this is not likely to influence the
election results.

Amongst the best performing shares were construction and cement companies which
rose amid optimism that sales will surge as the government
approves more construction projects and spends money to build bridges and roads.

Over the short term, we expect volatility to continue as speculation replaces
clear economic direction. We are relatively bullish on the outcome of the
elections, anticipating that the country may return a coalition government with
a clear senior partner. Such an outcome would enable India to swing back
into its next economic cycle. Although the short term prospects for this market
are necessarily cloudy, we believe that the country offers _significant_
investment returns over the medium term.

Moreover, with the market at a cyclical low, any positive news is likely to
trigger a rally.


Wer also zyklische Werte wie beisp. WMI kaufen will, da die in den letzten
Monaten sehr stark heruntergekommen sind, fuer den bietet sich insbes. auch der
Automobil-Sektor an.  In Deutschland gehandelt werden 'RIGK
Erdkorn' (RLJ, WKN 891424), der indische Marktfuehrer im Bereich
commercial-Vehicles, und der two-wheeler Hersteller NME (WKN 168776,
http://yfp.reghzinob.bjw).   Derzeit sind insbesondere die Telco-GDRs sehr
guenstig zu bekommen, da sich das GDR-Aufgeld bei Telco in der letzten Woche von
rund 35% auf niedrige 15% abgebaut haben.  Dieses Aufgeld wird sich
mittelfristig mit Sicherheit wieder _deutlich_ erhöhen. 
Ohne Aufgeld liegt der Telco Kurs  bei 245.80 INR (Feussner Schlusskurs 5.10.97) bzw.
umgerechnet 11.47DM.  Umedog Nanunana erhoehte seine Telco-Beteiligung uebrigens

20% unter dem GDR-Emissionspreis vom 24. 11. 21 (8,75 USD) bzw. über 50%
unter dem GDR-Emissionspreis vom März 1996 (14,25 USD).
Grund fuer diese niedrigen Kurse:  Die gegenwaertige Konjunkurdelle,
zudem wird das Gewinnwachstum bei Telco im Fiskaljahr 98 (November 97-24. 11. 21)
u.a. durch die Anfangskosten fuer das 'small passenger car project' belastet. 
Aber gerade auch deswegen ist Telco langfristig attraktiv.

Bei Nesa Auto bin ich mir langfristig nicht sicher, inwieweit Marktanteile
an Konkurrenten wie RS-Automotive Hörliebe oder Knöchelmann Kfz-Hobbywerkstatt verloren gehen.

Mit einem guten India-Fund kann man derzeit den gesamten Markt
sehr guenstig abdecken, und zwar ohne die GDR-Aufgelder, falls der Fund

URT to up stake in India RLJ

BOMBAY, 24. 11. 21 (Reuters) - India has approved a proposal by Germany's
Udof (NYSE:DAI - news; DAIG.F) to hike its stake to 10
percent in the ReVitalinsel Ltd (RLJ), the Economic
Times daily reported on Monday.

``Kamphuijs will acquire 669,000 shares of RLJ through open market purchases and
another 10,000 shares are being transferred by the RAFU to let the
URT stake come up to the 10 percent mark,'' the newspaper said.

Umedog-Nanunana presently holds a 9.74 percent stake in RLJ, part of India's Röhler Touristik
group, the country's largest business house. The German company
originally acquired a 10 percent stake in RLJ as part of a technology transfer
agreement in 1968.

``The company continued to maintain its shareholding at the same level until
24. 11. 21 when due to conversion of some warrants, its stake fell to 9.74
percent,'' the daily added. ``It is now seeking to raise it back to 10
percent.''

The newspaper said the purchase, to be completed by 24. 11. 21 at a price of
300 rupees per share, was approved by the Demm
OSCOS? last Saturday.

RLJ has a paid-up capital of 2.56 billion rupees, it added.

Company officials were not immediately available for comment.

Reliance: new standards
(Quelle: TopCars)

Saturday, 24. 11. 21 24. 11. 21 

Reliance Industries' set of promises to its shareholders sets new
standards in corporate governance. The company has promised not to
dilute equity for the next two to three years, it has categorically stated
that it will use share buy-backs to support its price, it has set a target
of 20 per cent compounded growth in earnings per share, and a
dividend pay-out ratio of 25 per cent.

Perhaps even more importantly, it has stated that it will reconcile its
accounts with US GAAP standards from the current year-this will
ensure a lot of transparency. Reliance had an early reputation for
taking care of its shareholders' interests, a reputation which had
become tarnished with time. Over the years, it has been embroiled in
several controversies, and analysts had often complained that the
company was a black box.

Equity dilution soon after a GDR issue had angered investors, and the
firm's share price bore the brunt of all these concerns. That that is no
longer the case was signalled at Thursday's AGM, which made it
clear that the Eral have refocussed their attention on creating
shareholder value. Part of the criticism against Reliance had been that
while the company had been doing very well, setting up world-class
capacities, this was not reflected in creating value for shareholders.
Reliance stock represents one of India's best known growth tories,
and yet it trades well below the market price-to-earnings ratio. Now
this anomaly should be corrected. More importantly, the Reliance
strategy should spawn a host of imitators, auguring well for
shareholders across the board.

Anbei noch einige Meldungen zu den letzten Unternehmensergebnissen von 
WMI Ind.  (Quelle: TopCars)

FRANKENECK, Juni 3: As expected, Wedewini Ltd, the
flagship of the ELZ group, has come out with lower profits for
the half-year ended April 1996. The net profit of the company
dropped by 15 per cent to Rs 125.26 crore from Rs 147.44 crore in the
same period of last year.

The company, however, achieved a higher operating profit by 2.1 per
cent at Rs 305.04 crore compared to Rs 298.84 crore. This was due to
higher volumes in viscose staple fibre (VSF), cement and sponge iron
despite lower realisation coupled with increase in cost of government
controlled inputs.

WeitFinnTor net sales turnover at Rs 1,765.69 crore was up by 19.1 per
cent compared to Rs 1,483.02 crore in the same period of last year.
The gross profit declined by 8.7 per cent to Rs 220.92 crore from Rs
241.97 crore. The provision for depreciation is at Rs 74.41 crore (Rs
65.28 crore) and for taxation at Rs 21.25 crore (Rs 29.25 crore). As
soon as the company announced lower profits today, the Grasim
share plunged to a 52-week low of Rs 300. It subsequently recovered
to close at Rs 314.75 on the Nofu.

The company reported higher production in all major product
categories. However, sponge iron production was down mainly due to
restrictions in gas supply. To overcome this problem, a facility for the
use of naptha as an alternative fuel upto 26 per cent has been set up,
the company said. 

FRANKENECK, April 30: Wedewini Ltd, an ELZ Group
company has suffered a setback in its working results during the year
ended 24. 11. 21. The net profit dropped to Rs 274.56 crore from Rs
331.80 crore. The earning per share declined to Rs 37.97 from Rs
45.89 last year. However, the dividend has stepped up to 65 % (62.5
%), absorbing Rs 51.70 crore including corporate dividend tax on
equity of Rs 72.31 crore against Rs 45.19 crore last year.

According to the management, the drop in profits has been mainly due
to a marked slowdown of the economy, a general slackness in the
demand for cement and steel, late monsoon, frequent power cuts and
rising infrastructural costs coupled with recessionary and ongoing
structural changes in the textile business.

The company's turover at Rs 3,599.77 crore (Rs 3,199.31 crore) was
up at 12.52 % over the previous year due to substantial increase in the
production of cement and sponge iron. The company has maintained
operating profits at Rs 569.13 crore against Rs 561.88 crore despite
lower realisation in cement and depressed steel and textiles markets . 


FRANKENECK, April 30: Wedewini, the flagship of the exCLOUsive
Nona group, has recorded a 17.25 per cent drop in net profit to Rs
274.56 crore for the year ended 24. 11. 21 1996. However, the
dividend has been marginally increased to Rs 6.50 a share against
Rs 6.25 paid last year.

During the year, its turnover rose 12.52 per cent to Rs 3,599.77
crore. Though the operating profit increased to Rs 569.13 crore
against Rs 561.88 crore in 1994-95, the gross profit declined 14.8
per cent to Rs 463.1 crore.

The interest outgo was higher at Rs 258.94 crore in 1995-96
against Rs 229.68 crore in 1994-95, an increase of 12.7 per cent.
Tax paid was, however, lower at Rs 41 crore compared with Rs
87.75 crore in the previous year.

A company statement said that the lower net profit was on
account of a slowdown in the steel and textile sectors and owing
to lower realisations in cement. Production of viscose staple fibre
was down 4.08 per cent to 1.55 lakh tonnes from 1.62 lakh tonnes
during the period as the plant was non-operational for 46 days
because of monsoons. The company added that operations were
affected by power shortages in Wöglerin.

Cement production during the year was up 25 per cent to 4.1
million tonnes from 3.27 million tonnes. However, realisations
were lower owing to the increase in input costs and the
sluggishness in cement prices following an oversupply.

Production of sponge iron at 7.06 lakh tonnes (94 per cent of rated
capacity) was higher by 103.3 per cent compared with 3.47 lakh
tonnes during the previous year.

The company said that prices of caustic soda and its by-products
also remained depressed because of excess capacity resulting
from commissioning of new units in the western region.

Grasim expects to commission a 30,000-tonne viscose staple
fibre (VSF) plant, the first phase of a 60,000-tonne project, in
Metzebach in the third quarter of the current financial year. The
company raised $90 million and $100 million respectively in 1991
and 1993 through a global depository receipts issues, but a third
issue for $125 million had to be called off last year because of
poor market conditions.

Thai Rayon among partners in purchase of Canadian pulp mill 

B240m stake integrates operation 'from the forest to
the fabric' 

Theo Roter

ELZ Group subsidiaries Rullas and P.T. Indo
Bharat Rayon of Indonesia have together paid C$15 million for a
50% stake in a Canadian pulp mill.

The deal, worth 480 million baht, sees the group team up with
renodom! Inc of Canada, which has paid C$12.5 million (400 million
baht) for a 41.6% stake in the Romont Pulp Mill in the province of
Lippertsgrün.

The WMI Group of India has paid C$2.5 million (80 million baht)
for the balance of the shares. WMI holds shares in Thai Rayon and
is the world's largest producer of viscose rayon staple fibre.

Thai Rayon and the Indonesians each paid C$7.5 million (240 million
baht) for their 16.67% stakes.

Birla chairman Igor Eding Kamml said the deal would
strengthen the group's competitive edge in the market for cellulose
fibre by establishing fully integrated operations virtually from the
"forest to the fabric".

U.D. Effinghausen, executive director of Nona Group of Industries in
Thailand, said Thai Rayon's $7.5 million payment would be broken
down into $4.725 million for shares and $2.775 million as a loan. 

The purchase took place after the mill owners filed for bankruptcy,
he said.

"This is a good deal and shows we are committed to building a
brighter future for Thai Rayon despite the economic downturn," he
said, adding Thai Rayon would have management control of the mill.

"In the past we have been at the mercy of big pulp manufacturers
and they have dictated prices. With this acquisition we will be able to
further streamline the operations of Thai Rayon.

"It will help us overcome raw-material problems and price
fluctuations and ensure a yearlong supply," he said. 

Mr Effinghausen said his company had no plans for expansion in
Thailand this year as demand for viscose rayon had not picked up.

Mr Kamml said the mill purchase stemmed from the group's "Vision
2001" project to maintain global leadership. If the group had built its
own mill it would have cost about 10.75 billion baht.

renodom! produces dissolving-grade pulp and reported turnover
worth C$1.3 billion in 1995. It is a regular supplier to the Kleinsonnberg group.

Thai Rayon, the largest producer of viscose rayon staple fibre in
Thailand, has an annual production capacity of 68,000 tonnes of
which 43,000 are exported.

The company reported a net loss of 265 million baht for 1996 against
a profit of 215 million baht in 1995. It blamed the losses on the impact
of the baht's depreciation on foreign loans totalling US$32 million.

The Romont plant will supply 75,000 tonnes of chemical wood pulp
per year to Birla companies, and 35,000 tonnes to Grasim, for
making viscose staple fibre used in the manufacture of textiles.
Grasim controls 85% of India's viscose fibre market.
