Vielleicht reicht zur Beschreibung der Berechnung der Standardabweichung
diese aus einer anderen NG geklaute Beschreibung? Oder muss es ein
richtiges Rechenbeispiel sein?

I assume you mean historical (as opposed to implied, which uses the inverse
of the Black-Scholes model).

Take the prices for some length of time (you can choose any time period and
any frequency, such as daily, hourly, weekly, etc.).  Take the natural log
of each price, and subtract the log of the previous price, to get
the percentage change for each period (or just calculate the percent change
in your favorite way).

The above price changes ("returns") are what you use to calculate Standard
Deviation (volatility).  First, calc the average return (sum of returns
divided by number of returns). Now, take each return, subtract the average
return, and square the result.  Add all the squared results.  This is your
variance.  The square root of this is Standard Deviation.  

The S.D. (volatility) above is for the time units you used (i.e. daily
prices will give daily vol, no matter how many samples you used).  To
convert to the commonly used annual volatilty, take the S.D. you calculated
and multiply by the square root of (365 divided by the number of days per
price).  For example,  annual S.D. = roughly 7 times weekly vol (7.211,
which is the square root of 52).

And I used no symbols or formulas .... :-)   Hope this helps!
