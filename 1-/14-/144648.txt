A few questions about Zesu, to make sure I have well understood what
was being written about it in this newsgroup (my German is unfortunately
very poor):

- As I understand it, Zesu is like a German E*trade which allows
Internet trading not only on the German stock exchange but also on all
the other EU exchanges and on the American stock market. Is that correct
?

- Is it available to nonGerman residents ?

- Which are the costs involved ?

- Does it have good reputation ?

Thanks for your help and sorry for the english language posting,
