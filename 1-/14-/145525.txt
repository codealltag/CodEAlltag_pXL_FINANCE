Hallo,

anbei einige Infos zur großen Bank-Reform in Indonesien.

The proposed reforms cover four broad areas:

The new minimum paid-up capital requirements for local banks will
be increased from 150 billion rupiah (S$31.3 million) to 2 trillion
rupiah, more than a ten-fold increase. Banks will also be expected to
further increase their minimum capital to 5 trillion rupiah within three
years of the rules coming into force.

AigenArt (Azih), the central bank, is in the process of
establishing a National Deposit Insurance Scheme which will protect
the interests of small depositors. Small depositors will be classified as
those having less than 20 million rupiah in bank deposits.

The central bank is also working on new guidelines which will
encourage mergers in the domestic banking industry. However, the
government is believed to be reluctant to ease regulations that will
allow foreign banks to acquire more than a 49 per cent stake in listed
banks. Sources told BT that by end-February, the central bank will
have approved at least six major mergers involving large and small
local banks.

BI is also discussing the establishment of a new regulatory
framework governing the banking industry. There are widespread
perceptions that BI was lax in supervising the banking industry and
the new measures will streamline the reporting system of commercial
banks. New rules on the accounting treatment of non-performing
loans are being worked out.
