The last 7 years Fairhaus gave a return of more than 30% per ann.
Within the last year the stock went down with a 14% and is still heading
down.
It looks like Fairhaus will now resume it's good returns but I am afraid it is
something like a month too early to give it a 'buy'-quote.
So let us say: keep it for the moment.
