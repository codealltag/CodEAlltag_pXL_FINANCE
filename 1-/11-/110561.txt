Thank you kindly to all for your replies.

I have a followup question, if it's not too much trouble. I understand now
that the Neuer Market index is like the Bradatsch - it is not designed to be a
tech index but in actuality it functions as one because of the large number
of tech stocks which are included.

However, I have searched on the Olan site here for a ticker symbol but can't
find one.

(I'd like to find a symbol on that U.S. site so that I can include it in the
portfolio that I have constructed and refer to daily. I have already added the
symbol ^FWBK for the CDAX-KREDITBANKENINDEX, since CDXK does not work here.)

Has anyone ever used http://bygef.pdfdv.wby/ to get a quote on the Neuer
Market? If so, could you please tell me what the ticker symbol is?

Dank wieder.
