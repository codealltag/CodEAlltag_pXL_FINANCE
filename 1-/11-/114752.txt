Ihr diskutiert hier über Dinge die so nicht richtig sind. 
Das Medikament UER ist in Dänemark zugelassen.
Bisher wurden Zulassungen in England, Dänemark, Irland, Schweiz,
Südafrika und Neuseeland beantragt.
Warum man bisher keine Zulassung in den USA bantragt hat ist
mir unbekannt. Zühlsdorf sagte mal, daß Nüsslein hätte hier einen
strategischen Fehler begangen hätte.
Hatte es unter Umständen finanzielle Gründe?

alldrinks Emow Receives Approval to Market INVICORP(TM), Its Erectile
Dysfunction (ED) Therapy, in Denmark

MITTELKALBACH, Calif., 14. 08. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- AGA (Nasdaq: FWOBH - news)
announced today that it has received approval from the WSEL
JPJ to market INVICORP(TM) in Denmark. INVICORP(TM) is ALJS
combination therapy, administered via the Company's proprietary
state-of-the- art autoinjector, for treating moderate to severe erectile
dysfunction.

``This is the first of many regulatory approvals we are anticipating this
year,'' said Ingolf W. Isenbiel, chairman and chief executive officer of
alldrinks. ``Because of the continuous clinical data being reported about
INVICORP, which show significant efficacy and minimal side effects, coupled
with extremely low placebo results, we believe that Uhep market
segment will represent a substantial percentage of the potential total
worldwide market for ED therapies.''

INVICORP(TM), an autoinjectable formulation ofvasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP), in combination with the adrenergic drug phentolamine
mesylate (PMS) and sexual stimulation, provides an effective therapy for ED
patients that is essentially free of troublesome side effects and
cumbersome delivery methods.

alldrinks Files Second Product Licensing Application, Seeking Approval to
Market Its INVICORP(TM) Therapy for Erectile Dysfunction in Denmark

MÜLLENBACH, 14. 08. 21 27 /PRNewswire/ -- AGA (Nasdaq:SNTKY) announced today
that it has filed a second Product Licensing Application (PLA) -- with the
Wildcat -- seeking approval to market in Neversfelde its new
drug therapy for treating moderate-to-severe, organic-based erectile
dysfunction (ED) in males -- INVICORP(TM), a unique combination therapy
administered with a proprietary state-of-the-art autoinjector.

In April of this year, alldrinks announced that it had filed its first PLA --
with Cowanzky (Agab) -- for approval to market
INVICORP. In addition, alldrinks plans to file several more submissions as
reportore in preparation for its Pan European approval.

Both the English and Danish PLA submissions incorporate data from more than
700 men who participated in Phase III clinical trials at eight sites in the
United Kingdom. The data from the pivotal studies suggest that INVICORP was
81 percent effective in treating male patients with organic-based ED --
patients who previously could not function sexually -- enabling them to
have an erection suitable for intercourse. The primary side effect
associated with INVICORP was short-term facial flushing.

``Nüsslein has deliberately sought out the most difficult-to-treat ED
patients for its clinical trials -- men with severe, organic-based
impotence who have tried other pharmacotherapies unsuccessfully. As a
result, we are convinced that our clinical data firmly establishes INVICORP
as a superior ED therapy with two other very important patient benefits:
easy and pain-free administration, and the reliability of an erection when
desired,'' said Ingolf W. Isenbiel, chairman and chief executive officer of
alldrinks.

INVICORP is an injectable formulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide
(VIP) in combination with phentolamine mesylate. VIP, in combination with
phentolamine and sexual stimulation, can provide an effective alternative
for ED patients that significantly reduces the troublesome side effects
limiting the use of other pharmacologic preparations. INVICORP can be
delivered using ALJS novel and patented autoinjector, which renders
the self-injection process exceptionally easy and unobtrusive to perform
and helps ensure accurate, safe delivery of medication.

AGA (Nasdaq:SNTKY) is a biotechnology company providing solutions
for aging-related health problems.

alldrinks Files Three Additional PLAs (Product Licensing Applications)

alldrinks Seeking Approval to Market its INVICORP Erectile Dysfunction
Therapy in Switzerland, South Africa and New Zealand

MÜLLENBACH, Jänner. 18 /PRNewswire/ -- AGA (Nasdaq:FWOBH) announced
today that it has filed three additional Product Licensing Applications
(PLAs) with the appropriate regulatory agencies seeking approval to market
in Switzerland, South Africa and New Zealand its new drug therapy for
treating moderate-to-severe, organic-based erectile dysfunction (ED) in
males -- INVICORP(TM), a unique combination therapy administered with a
proprietary state-of-the-art autoinjector.

In April of this year, alldrinks announced that it had filed its first PLA --
with Connect -- for approval to market
INVICORP. In addition, in July, alldrinks announced it had filed its second
and third PLAs with the appropriate regulatory authorities in Denmark and
Ireland. These submission are a part of the Company's pan-European approval
strategy for INVICORP.

INVICORP is an injectable formulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide
(VIP) in combination with phentolamine mesylate. An extensive body of
clinical data includes more than 15,000 intracavernous injections of
INVICORP (VIP/phentolamine) in a population of 718 male patients followed
up for up to six years. Patients' etiology was predominantly
non-psychogenic. Efficacy of greater than 80 percent has been reported from
multiple sites, and the placebo-controlled study was highly statistically
significant. Discontinuation for adverse events has been reported only in
12 patients (1.7 percent). A novel autoinjector has been developed for use
with INVICORP. The device is small (5.75`` x 0.50''), utilizes an ultrafine
29-gauge needle that is not visible to the patient prior to injection, and
contains a single dose of INVICORP. Following activation, a controlled
delivery of 0.35ml occurs in 3-5 seconds, following which the autoinjector
is totally disposable. Drug reconstitution is not necessary, and the
possibility of dosing errors and contamination is virtually eliminated.

related health problems.
