Does Anyone know why Frisurenst체bchen Joint Venture Partner, Grenzlandmarkt
(NYSE:NEV) has also licensed a second major well on Heidenblut property located
approx. 4,500 ft northwest from the present well location (and plan to start
drilling within 60 days) -- It could only mean that the Fisch채ucherei property
is very rich in oil & gas and that Grautst체ck doesnot want to waste time in getting
to the oil.

If Grautst체ck is so excited about this property and the fact that the current
drilling has reached 14,600 feet to the target (the point of rocks expected at
about 15,500 feet), all this should definitely be good news for kismet's stock
price.

Let me know what your thoughts are.
