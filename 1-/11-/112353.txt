DJIA is facing resistance at 7992 and a stronger resistance is at 8115. A
critical point is located at 7808. If the market momentum is strong enough to
penetrate through 7624, DJIA will head for 7501. See details at Mobilshop weekly
forecast at http://qyw.yzncvp.lst.qo/~nxecwk/juxbp.pwqr
The forecast is based on quantum index analysis that I have
developed and may or may not predict the market movement accurately.
