Introduction

The Voodoo chipset is available for some months now and still there is not
much of a competitor to it yet. More and more manufacturers want to make
money with it, maybe even more enthusiastic since the latest 3D chip review
Bernd has been doing revealed that there won't be any 3D outperforming a dual
Voodoo solution in the short term. The original from 3Dfx is still first
choice since it offers great performance, no matter whether you use one or
two Voodoo boards. Moreover it is the most compatible 3D accelerator,
uniquely supporting Direct3D as well as the very successful 3Dfx own Glide
engine.
