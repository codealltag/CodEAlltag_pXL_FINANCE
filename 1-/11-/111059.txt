The frequency chart of quantum index analysis indicates that 1.6540 is the
critical point. Dollar-mark will vibrate around 1.6275 +/- 0.0132 early this
week. Each quantum jump for dollar/mark is represented by 0.0132. The down
trending signal for dollar/mark is hoisted and the market has a good
potential to go lower and may challenge the supporting point at 1.5877, see
details at http://dpc.qppwwa.afd.qc/~mkdxrr/qcwamj-ztul.pkvy This forecast is
based on a mathematical model and it may or may not predict the market
accurately.
