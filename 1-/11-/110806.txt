Dear,

 I am a researcher in the technical analysis field and my works start to
spread all around the world.
For instance read my article in the August issue of "Futures magazine", the
world leader magazine as regards technical analysis. You can find it even
online at: http://yfm.njqjmnltaq.biq/oyktuox/pjrnsl45/nadowknfj.lkmb.

I am very interested in the capability of the internet of drawing people
together, and therefore I would like to attempt an international technical
analysis course via the internet for very few people, I'd say 3 or 4. It should
last about 3 or 4 months and deal with the most important topics. Depending on
the people who would like to attend it we'll choose the level of the course.
I'll ask for 395$ contribution. Of course this contribution is asked, above
all, to make your seriousness sure. Anyhow for this price you could't even
pay a half-day seminar.
