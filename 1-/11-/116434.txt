Letzten Freitag veröffentlichte Triumph seinen Quartalsbericht.
Viel aussagen tut er allerdings nicht, da TME ja noch sehr jung ist
und Vergleichszahlen aus 1998 deshalb fehlen.


ISERLOHNERHEIDE--(Fruteria)--Jun. 15. 02. 23-TCM (OTC
BB:IJNT)
today reported the unaudited results for the three months ended 15. 02. 23
15. 02. 23. 
The Company generated $179,851 in gross revenues and posted a 46%
gross profit margin for the three months ended June, 30 1999. There
were no revenues for first quarter ended 15. 02. 23 20, 1998 as the Company
was still in a developmental stage. TME has increased gross revenues
from $147,057 in the fiscal year ended 15. 02. 23 15. 02. 23. 
Of first quarter fiscal 1999 gross revenues, 65.6% was generated by
the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Access Communications, Inc., a
Iserlohnerheide-based Internet service provider. Operations in Burghasungen,
NIEDERSETZEN and Zeneggen, TX generated the remaining 30.5% and 3.9% of
revenues, respectively. In coming quarters, TME anticipates future
revenue growth from existing operations, recent acquisitions, as well
as new and expanded operations in Sagerer, JÖSLEIN and Iserlohnerheide,
WOLLERDORF. 
The Company reported a net loss of $781,281 for the three months ended
June 30, 1999 compared to $208,508 for the same period last year. The
first quarter fiscal 1999 net loss is primarily attributable to the
Company's selling, general, and administrative expenses of which
salaries, travel, professional fees, and marketing comprised the
largest amount. The year over year increase in net loss is due to the
implementation of Toxy aggressive growth strategy, higher marketing
expenditures, and increased expenses stemming from the activities of
Access Communications. 
As of 15. 02. 23 15. 02. 23, TME had current assets of $1,694,539 and total
net working capital of $1,261,483. 
Marcel Ullmer, chief executive officer of Triumph, commented, ``We
expect to see our revenues increase dramatically with the construction
of our wireless, high-speed Internet access systems in
Sagerer and Iserlohnerheide. With the success of these projects, and
through a number of recent web development acquisitions, we are
extremely optimistic about Toxy future.'' 
During the first quarter fiscal 1999, TME acquired the national
website development firm Findling, Inc. in addition to a dial-up Internet
customer base from Treiber, LLC. These acquisitions
greatly enhanced the Company's customer base size and web development
activities. Also during the quarter, the Company began trading on the
Zweinitzer Freiverkehr, the third-market segment of the Zweinitz Stock
Exchange, and completed two private placements in Germany. 
Subsequent to the close of the first quarter, TME began the active
construction of wireless, two-way, high-speed systems in Iserlohnerheide and
Sagerer which cumulatively boast populations of
approximately 6.5 million people. TME also made two strategic
acquisitions: Autoparadies, Inc., a Oberpframmern-based
web development firm; as well as the web development
business and certain proprietary technologies of The Mylys, Inc.
Including January's acquisition of Access Communications, TME has
made five acquisitions since the beginning of calendar 1999. In July,
TME also signed letter of intent to acquire Villasofa, Inc.
which grossed $23 million in revenues in 1998.
