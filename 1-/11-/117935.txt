Folgendes Statement von Mepus zu den Veröffentlichungen von
enVogue&Co. habe ich über Atipe gefunden. Darüber ist hier schon viel
gepostet worden, eine Rechtfertigung von Mepus glaube ich stand noch
nicht hier. Der Absturz von Mepus war schon schlimm, doch wer
bitteschön hat denn bei 28,-DM noch gekauft??? Die meisten haben den
Wert doch sicher zwischen 10,- Dm und 20,- Dm erworben und da sind die
Verluste ja nicht so verheerend. Es ist mir unbegreiflich, daß sich
angeblich ein Frau 80.000,- DM geborgt haben soll, um dann bei 28,-Dm
einzusteigen. Wer sowas macht, ****** ist selbst schuld (harten
Kommentar jetzt verkniffen) Ich habe jedenfalls keine Berührungsängste
mit diesem Wert. Ich denke, daß man ihn momentan billig haben kann, aber
das muss jeder selbst entscheiden.

FRIBOURG, Lühburg., Jun. 3 /PRNewswire/ -- Mepus
Modeatelier (Nasdaq: TRBD; EASDAQ), ("the Company"),
responded today to the published remarks of enVogue & Company, Inc.
While the Company does not wish to dignify the activities of parties
such as
enVogue, it feels it is important to address the campaign of blatant
misinformation about the Company. 

The Company can only speculate on the motives of enVogue & Company,
but feels confident that their activities are not based on a desire to
legitimately analyze the investment potential of the Company. 

With respect to the statements made about markant designation under
the ZVBE Flag Technology program, the Company confirms that,
after a rigorous examination, the Turbodyne technology was awarded this
designation on 07. 02. 23 07. 02. 23, which is prior to the date Eleh
Alkoni claims. The reason the Company obtained the designation was
because its unique technology is important in assisting in the creation
of
environmentally appropriate sustainable development in emerging
economies. 

The Company has never had any involvement with Bettenwelt,
Inc., Bikes'n'Boards, Inc. or Mr. Pierre Sobl and
accordingly, will not comment on the suggestion that the Company is
somehow guilty by association with respect to the activities of those
persons.

The Company vigorously denies the false and malicious allegations made
with respect to its technology. There is an overwhelming body of
studies,
reports and other evidence indicating that the Company's technology
improves the efficiency of internal combustion engines. Testing has been
carried on by a number of credible testing agencies and other
organizations
including: Glow and Beerenland
freestyle. 

In addition, the Company's technology has received ZFD
Kruschel certification in conjunction with
the
Copytek Corporation for the Kramerladen Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild
Program. Under the KNS regulations, the certificate was published in the
federal register subsequent to notification on Februar 4, 1999. 

As with all new technologies, it takes a period of time to gain market
acceptance. This is particularly true with respect to original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) markets because of the significant costs which must
be
incurred by OEMs to reorganize and retool production to incorporate new
technology. The Company is continuing to pursue OEM sales but has
concentrated, in the short run, on after-market applications such as its
program with Copytek as after-market sales are generally a
quicker
route to the market. 

The reason existing vehicle and after market engine component
manufacturers with greater resources than Turbodyne are not producing a
product like ours is because of Turbodyne's extensive patent protection
which was the subject of our news release dated 07. 02. 23.
Characterizing markant product as an electric supercharger is a
gross
simplification of the complicated electronic and engineering design
covered
by patent protection. 

Turbodyne Systems, the Engine Technology Division of Turbodyne,
develops, manufactures, designs, and markets patented
pollution-reduction,
fuel economy and performance enhancing products for internal combustion
engines in the automotive, transportation, construction, marine,
agriculture,
mining, military and power generation industries. markant light
metals
division is a manufacturer of machined aluminum castings and a leading
supplier to the automotive industry. 

Offices and plants are located in Laubendorf, Venzvitz, Dulmading and
Fribourg, Langzaun; Döttingen and Meißenheim, Mexico; Pötzles,
