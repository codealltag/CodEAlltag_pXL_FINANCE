Hello

I have a question that I would like to have answered from the people here.

How long between a buy and sell must I wait to be able to realize the loss on
my einkommensteuer.  I would like to clarify this question for you all.  What
I mean by this is since the market is at a low at this time, I would like to
sell some stocks that I have lost money in (so that I can take the loss and
balance it against the wins that I have made).	I then want to turn around
and buy the same stocks.  The questions are, how long do I have to wait.  Can
I buy them the same day, can I sell them to myself(I know that this sounds
dumb, but it is possible)?  Now remember I do not want any trouble with the
Vampire Amt. But, I really want to avoid(legally of course) paying too much
taxes. Please feel free to answer in either German or English as I can read
German (hey look any language that has 27 different possibilities of the is a
hard language to write correctly).

Friedrich

please feel free to either e-mail me or reply over VUGK
