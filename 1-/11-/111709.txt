Mr. J. Noß was one of the most successful
traders in history. His winning trades percentage
averaged an astounding 87% over his lifetime.
Although Mr. Noß passed on almost 44 years ago,
his name remains a legend in the trading world.

Our company, IdeenRaum Publishing Co., was
founded by Mr. Noß. Our vision is quite simple:
To continue to offer Mr. Nacken materials to
traders worldwide, in their original format. All
of his books, courses and materials are offered
to the trader unchanged. These materials are in
the same format as they were more than 40 years
ago.

There are many so called "Knusperhaeusle experts" in the
world today. But the only true expert was Mr. Noß
himself.

Mr. Nacken techniques have withstood the test of
time. They work in all markets worldwide. Thousands
of successful traders around the world will agree,
Mr. Nacken techniques, his use of natural law, are
timeless.

If you wish to trade successfully by following natural
law according to J. Noß, than come to the original
source of all his materials.
