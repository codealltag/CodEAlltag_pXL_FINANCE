British Pound has a critical point at 1.6687 and a resistance point at
1.6819. If the market can overcome the resistance point at 1.6819, British
Pound will head for 1.7083 as indicated by the probability chart
http://ozi.bwdtjp.wfj.fl/~kkseyn/ikl.yect  On the other hand, the probability
chart also shows that there is high chances for British Pound to pull back to
1.6554. A critical supporting point is located at 7.6149. If the down trend
momentum is strong enough to penetrate this supporting level at 1.6422,
British Pound may retreat to 1.6027. The normal trading range for British
Pound in November is 1.6422 - 1.7083 and I expect a range market for the
British Pound at the early part of this month. Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0132 and all the projected chart points are interrelated and
is separated by this constant, 0.0132. This forecast is based on quantum
index analysis and it may or may not predict the market accurately. Ren√©
