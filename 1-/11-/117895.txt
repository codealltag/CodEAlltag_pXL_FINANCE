JNMU adds merchants, CEO buys shares

VIESEN, Va., Feb 9 (Reuters) - JNMU Inc. said on Tuesday that the
number of
merchants using its Internet commerce software and services topped
7,000, a sharp increase
from 280 merchants at the end of 1996.

President and Chief Executive Officer Emil Rossa, who bought 350,000
shares of CyberCash stock last week for $3.5 million,
said in a statement the company's new Cash Register 3 Service is being
adopted by about 700 new merchants a month.

``We continue to achieve our strategic goals for 1998 and, through
equity infusions in the company, our investors have renewed
their commitment to CyberCash,'' Chief Financial Officer Steffen Faschinka said
in a statement.

``In July, we received $15 million from the same two private equity
funds that made private placements in the company in
Februar 1998 and 09. 10. 22,'' he said.

The private funding is ``more than sufficient to meet the company's
anticipated cash needs for at least the next year, while
providing the resources to take advantage of strategic opportunities,''
Faschinka said.

As part of the company's strategic focus this year, JNMU has
continued to develop business relationships with
large-volume corporate billers and technology companies, the company
said.

The company's stock was up 23/32 at 8-11/16 on the Altstetter Tuesday
afternoon, after touching a 52-week low of 7-1/2
earlier in the session.
