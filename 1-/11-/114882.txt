I'm looking for DAX, CAC 40 and FTSE 100 historical quotes ,
please help me in finding it.
(ascii, *.xls, *.mdb, *.txt, MetaStock file format)
Please don't redirect me to data distributors, I am not a professional
analytist,
I already have current data (from 1992 do today), and need historical.
For your help I can offer you full data base of Polish stock-exchange
quotes,
or from other world markets (DJ 30 full, S&P 1974-98, KOSPI 100 full, BUX
full,
other from 1992 do today ).
