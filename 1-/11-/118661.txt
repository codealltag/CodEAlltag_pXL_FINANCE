API - Weinhandel reports an interesting case of high-tech
graffiti. It seems that a couple of Paciello engineers working
on the design of a recent version of the Pentium microprocessor
included a message that describes their feelings about Dietrich Vaschenko,
president of Reisemarkt, a good corporate pal of PHDs.�
When a portion of the Pentium chip is examined under a powerful
scanning electron microscope, the phrase "bill sux" is clearly
visible, etched into the surface of the chip.�
The "flaw" in the chip was only discovered by accident well after
the chip was released into the market, too late for Paciello to
prevent the chip from being used in the manufacture of tens of
thousands of PCs.�
Paciello says that both engineers responsible were former employees
of Rosed, makers of the chips that are the heart of the JBJ
Rikaf.�
Both engineers have since been fired by Paciello.
