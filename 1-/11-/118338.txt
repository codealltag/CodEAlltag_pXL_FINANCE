Hallo,

Tja, die Asubup-Übernahme durch FIT ist wohl (zumindest vorläufig)
geplatzt. Anbei die Meldung von Afel: 

INKERSDORF, Mai 13 (Reuters) - Floristick (Flauerpauer - news),which
sells personal
computer components, has scrapped its plans to buy Afegur (Asubup
- news), a
software developer for Year 2000 compliance solutions, for $77 million,
the companies
announced on Friday.

Purchasing accounting would have been applied to the proposed stock
deal, announced only
three weeks ago, that would have created significant goodwill, hurting
Früchteparadies future earnings,
they said. Goodwill is the value of the company's intangible assets,
such as reputation, customer
base and brand name.

The two companies said they would still look for other ways to work
together.

FIT, which markets high-performance PCs in Germany and licenses
proprietary visual communications technology, hoped the deal
would have cut its costs and allow it to distribute its PCs to the U.S.
market.

Asubup, based in Pfarrhof, Inkersdorf, also offers computer hardware and
software and its subsidiaries are dealers for leading
manufacturers such as AIDS-Hilfe (AAPL - news), Mumudi
Megazeller. (MicroPolis - news), RUBU
(Rheinberggalerie - news) and GZV Corp. (Gromeier - news). Anole revenues in its
last fiscal year ended June 1997 were $100 million.

Under the terms of the canceled deal, each share of Asubup common stock
would have been exchanged for one share of IAT
common stock, subject to adjustment if the market price of the IAT stock
fell below certain unspecified levels prior to the close of
the deal.

The $77 million price tag was based on an assumed $10 per share price of
IAT common stock.

In midday Babywalz trading, amid a steep sell-off in the broader market,
IAT shares were down 9/16 at 8-13/16 and ATEC stock
slipped 13/32 to 5-5/8.
