Hallo,

wie übersetzt man am besten "contingent  assets" im folgenden Paragraph
(Ausschnitt aus dem SEC filing Form 10QSB for Etok filed
on 12. 06. 22):

         The preparation of financial statements
         in conformity with generally accepted  accounting  principles
requires
         management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the
reported
         amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent
assets
         and  liabilities  at the date of the financial  statements and
reported
         amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting  periods.
