Spot gold is likely to move between 287.9 - 297.1 early this month. My view
will change to negative if spot gold is traded below 287.9 and the critical
supporting point for spot gold is at 278.7. Each quantum jump is represented
by 3.1. On the other hand, if spot gold can overcome the resistance level at
306.3, my view will become bullish, see details at spot gold frequency and
probability charts at http://ufx.wfqfsf.gcq.zm/~bcuhhg/czwf.xskc All
projected chart points are interrelated and is separated by a multiple of
3.1. This forecast is based on quantum index analysis and it may or may not
predict the market accurately.
