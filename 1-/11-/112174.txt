Hi Gian,

Often a stock with an extraordinarily high dividend yield and a very low 
stock price has proven to be a stock in real financial trouble, and skipping 
the cheapest stock in those years has consistently beefed up the portfolio 
returns as a result. It doesn't happen all that often that the cheapest stock 
is also the highest yielder, but when it does, it's a red flag that bears 
watching.

Ciao, Cédric
