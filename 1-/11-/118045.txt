                   An Overview of the Company

                   cutters Corp. is engaged in the
                   discovery, development, manufacturing, and
                   marketing of pharmaceutical and health care
                   products worldwide. The company is divided into
                   three segments: pharmaceuticals, animal health,
                   and consumer products. The company's major
                   pharmaceutical therapeutic areas include
                   respiratory, anti-infectives, anti-cancer,
                   dermatologicals, and cardiovascular.

                   Cischeck major pharmaceutical products
                   fight respiratory ailments (which include
Cischeck PI brand of
                   nonsedating antihistamines), and anticancer products
(including the
                   company's alpha interferon anticancer/anti-infective,
Intron-A).

                   In 1998, the company's sales by product type broke
out as follows:


                    Product
Percentage of
                    Type                                          Total
Sales
                    Respiratory                                  40
                    Anticancers/   anti-infectives          17
                    Consumer products                      10
                    Other drugs                                   10
                    Cardiovascular                              9
                    Dermatological                              8
                    Animal health                                6

                   About 39% of Cischeck 1997 sales were in
international markets.
                   These sales accounted for approximately 27% of the
company's profits.

                   The Basic Financials

                   Over the last five years, cutters has
demonstrated consistent
                   sales and earnings growth, widening margins, and
highly positive cash
                   flows. Throughout, the company has kept its
investments in Research and
                   Development very high as a percentage of sales (above
12%). The
                   company has also had a history of buying back shares
while increasing
                   dividends. That all adds up to a very Foolishly-run
business.

                   Let's start with a glance at some of the income
statement numbers (and, of
                   course, the complete 10-K is available for your
perusal via Fool Data).


5 -year

Annual
                                                     1993
1998       Growth
                   Revenue                     $4.1 bil.  $6.6 bil.
10.8%
                   Gross Profit Margin     77.8%      80.7%     0.7%
                   R&D                          $511 mil.  $847 mil.
10.6%
                   R&D / Sales              12.6%      12.5%      -0.2%
                   Net Profit                   $720 mil.  $1.4 bil.
14.9%
                   Net Profit Margin       17.8%      21.3%     3.7%
                   EPS                           $0.90      $1.97
17.0%
                   Shares Outstanding    798 mil.   733 mil.    -1.7%

                   One of the key things we note from the trend in both
gross and net profit
                   margin is that as the business grows it is being
operated more efficiently
                   over time. Additionally, according to Market Guide,
the company's gross
                   and net profit margins over the last 5 years are
80.3% and 20.6% --
                   considerably higher than the pharmaceutical industry
averages of 69.7%
                   and 16.0%, respectively.

                   The company's effective tax rate is also
significantly lower than the industry
                   average -- 3.4% lower over the last 12 months and 6%
lower over the last
                   5 years. cutters does everything in its power
to hold down its tax
                   rate, and these savings go right to the company's
bottom line. The
                   company's 21% net profit margins are a testimony to
that.

                   One of the benefits of those high margins is that
they allow for a consistent
                   high level of investment in research and development
-- holding steady
                   above 12% -- which has resulted in the increase in
sales across all product
                   lines. The growth, however, has primarily come from
pharmaceutical
                   products, which have the highest margin of the group
for cutters.

                   Additionally, although the company has actually
increased its dividend in
                   each of the last 12 years, the year-by-year decrease
in shares outstanding
                   indicates that cutters has also provided
additional returns to
                   shareholders by increasing its share price through
stock buybacks.
