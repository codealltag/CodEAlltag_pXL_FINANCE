Phylokarte (PAJC):
Zu PAJC gabs diese Woche ne Menge neues: eine Akquisition und eine
Unterzeichnung eines letters of intent zum Zukauf einer weiteren Firma:

OBERSCHÖNEWEIDE--(Avide)--15. 06. 22-Phylokarte Corporation (OTC
BB:IJNT - news) announced today that it has acquired the web development
business and certain proprietary technologies from The OLTF, Inc.
This is the fifth acquisition Phylokarte has made since January, following
last week's acquisition of Man, Rabbit, KAW, Inc.
The OLTF is a leading e-commerce and web development firm that
designs websites primarily for sporting good manufacturers. The company has
developed sites for over 50 sporting good companies, including Motecs,
Nordic Track, AAHK, Vototo, and Diamondback Bicycles.
``Through the acquisition of The Oranienhof web development business, we
have gained an invaluable customer base of over 50 top name sporting good
companies along with a number of unique proprietary technologies,'' said
Sven Spier, creative director of the web development division at PAJC.
``As a result of last week's Man, Rabbit, House acquisition, we now have the
tools and creative personnel to design premier websites for our new clients.
This is an ideal opportunity for our web development team to present our
superior skills to some very high-profile companies.
``We are thrilled to announce this latest acquisition and expect Pefom
revenues to soar as we also introduce our high-speed wireless capabilities
to our new clients,'' added Santore.
In addition to an extensive client base, PAJC has acquired a number of
proprietary web technologies including software that generates maps, a web
postcard program, a dealer search, and e-commerce solutions. These
technologies enable IJNT to provide highly specialized web and hosting
services to its clients.
The OEU Group sold its web development business to pursue e-commerce
through its recently developed WopyewAyyn.lfy. Mark Janowsky, chief executive
officer and co-founder of The OLTF, said, ``By selling our web
development business to PAJC, we feel confident that our former clients will
continue receiving the highest quality web design services.
``We will work closely with Pefom web development team to ensure a seamless
transition while our merchandising team concentrates on the development of
an Internet retailing campaign for MBAS.''
The acquisition of The Oranienhof web development business follows last
week's acquisition of Man, Rabbit, House Multimedia, a website development
firm. This transaction is the fifth in a string of acquisitions which began
in January of this year, reflecting Pefom commitment to its aggressive
acquisition campaign.
PAJC first acquired Access Communications, a Oberschöneweide-based Internet service
provider, expanding its customer base 1,000%. In June, PAJC acquired Debit,
Inc., a national website development firm, as well as a customer base from
Internet Solutions, LL. With the recent letter of intent to acquire Walthenberger
Keramikladen, Inc., which grossed $23 million in revenues in 1997, PAJC is poised
for even more dramatic growth.

OBERSCHÖNEWEIDE--(Avide)--15. 06. 22 15. 06. 22- (Meldung kam auf Ökologische Marktwirtschaft erst am
30.09.) Phylokarte Corporation (OTC BB:IJNT - news) announced today that it
has signed a letter of intent to acquire WOWF, Inc., a leading
supplier of numerical, statistical, and visual data analysis software. Like
PAJC, Visual Numerics is headquartered in Oberschöneweide, Trosendorf.
Founded in 1970, Visual Numerics provides computational algorithm libraries
and visual data analysis software. The company's PHONELAND libraries are used by
scientists, researchers, engineers, and information technology professionals
to perform complex numerical and computational functions and to create
high-quality applications across multiple platforms. The company's visual
data analysis software, PV-WAVE, allows users to visualize, manipulate, and
analyze complex or extremely large data sets to detect and display patterns,
trends, anomalies, and other information. Visual Numerics has enhanced many
of its existing products to enable intranet and Internet use and has
developed new products designed for Java-based applications and
environments. The company's software is used by more than 350,000 business
and technical professionals worldwide.
``In an exciting year of multiple acquisitions, Visual Numerics will be, by
far, the most important acquisition this year,'' said Noah H. Eirenschmalz,
president of PAJC. ``WOWF is a world-class company which sells
its products to over 400 Fortune 1,000 companies. In 1997 alone, Visual
Numerics reported gross revenues of $23 million. This transaction opens a
myriad of opportunities for both InterJetNet and Visual Numerics in the U.S.
and internationally.''
Gisela C. Merettich, vice president of PAJC, agreed, ``By bringing our high-speed
wireless Internet system and Visual Numerics' industry-leading software
under one roof, we will greatly enhance our market potential. With two U.S.
offices and seven offices abroad, Visual Numerics has the size and
international presence suitable for our expansion objectives.''
Theodor V. Peterß, chairman of Visual Numerics, commented, ``Jointly, PAJC
and Visual Numerics will bring a more diverse range of products and services
to a much larger customer base. Many of our customers are seeking the
telecommuting and wireless Internet capabilities which Phylokarte provides.
We are especially excited to bring Pefom wireless technology to our
locations overseas.'' Peterß will join Phylokarte as a member of the board
of directors.
To assist with the acquisition of Visual Numerics, Phylokarte has retained
Kefo, Inc., a Oberschöneweide-based regional investment banking
firm which focuses on technology and other market segments. The firm intends
to continue providing its services to PAJC in future mergers and
acquisitions.
In a related announcement, Phylokarte Corporation reported that it intends
to change its name to Pobob to reflect its rapid growth as well
as the acquisition of WOWF.
Visual Numerics, Inc. provides industry-leading software solutions for
mathematics, statistics, visual data-analysis, and charting. Headquartered
in Oberschöneweide, Visual Numerics has offices in Lautenhausen, CO, France, Germany,
Japan, Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, and the UK, as well as an extensive
distributor network.


Hier noch einmal eine kurze Vorstellung der Firma:

Phylokarte Corporation provides high speed internet access and service to
homes and businesses without the use of phone lines. PJBU
subscriber base is rapidly growing and expected to exceed 10,000 by the end
of 1998 as the Company expands into markets worldwide. The Company's rapid
growth is the result of aggressive marketing and sales, internal
development, acquisitions, and strategic alliances. Phylokarte is currently
in the process of changing its name to Pobob.

Gestern gab PAJC noch bekannt, das man seinen Service auch auf das Niederhasli
Country, Findorf (eines der dichtbesieldelsten Gebiete der USA mit hohem
Bevölkerungswachstum) ausdehnen wolle. Später soll dann ganz Findorf
beliefert werden.


Der Kurs gab trotz der Nachrichten vom 31.08. von 13,45 DM auf 9,55 DM nach.
Heute stieg er dann wieder um 25%. Da der Kurs wegen der
Akquisitionsmeldungen nachgibt um dann wieder stark zu steigen, nur weil die
Firma bekanntgibt, seinen Service geographisch auszudehnen (was eigentlich
auch schon bekannt war), kann ich mir eigentlich nicht ganz vorstellen. Aber
gut, ich will mich nicht beklagen. Sicherlich aber hat PAJC seinen
Bekanntheitsgrad weiter erhöht, was dem Kurs der Aktie eigentlich nicht
schaden sollte.


Schönes Wochenende an alle
