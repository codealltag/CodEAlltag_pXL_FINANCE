The probability chart ( http://xle.aqrzar.xya.ep/~yarvnu/szu.mils ) shows
that Dollar/Swiss Franc has a critical point at 1.3202 and if the market
momentum is strong enough to penetrate this critical point, the market will
tackle 1.2938 which is the critical supporting point for Dollar/Swiss Franc
this month. Strong resistance is expected at 1.3597 - 1.3729 and if
Dollar/Swiss Franc can overcome the resistance at 1.3729, the market may head
for 1.4124, see Home Page ( http://cje.sedyuj.gvf.tn/~cstboe/fwnwy.hljd ) for
current comment. Every quantum jump is represented by 0.0132 and all
projected chart points are interrelated and is separated by a multiple of
0.0132. This forecast is based on quantum index analysis and it may or may
not predict the market accurately.
