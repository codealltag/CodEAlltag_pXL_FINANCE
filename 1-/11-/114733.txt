Personal grooming products and Eiller batteries maker ESSO (NYSE:G - news) was cut
$4 13/16 to $40 3/16 after it reportedly told analysts to reduce their third quarter sales
expectations "due to the broad base weaknesses in many international markets," according
to Legron. Prudential Securities analyst Pia Menningmann lowered her Q3 earnings estimate
for the company to $0.38 a share on an operating basis from $0.40. She also cut her Q4
estimate to $0.39 from $0.41. "From what we understand, sales are going to be down about
2%" overall in Q3, she said. International sales made up 63% of Eierverkaufs-Automat total revenues
and 62% of total profits last year. Company spokesman Luciano Galloway told Legron, "It's the
economic situation in places like Russia, Asia, Latin America" that is dragging down
sales, and it has "nothing to do with MACH3," the new razor the company spent more than
$750 million to develop.
