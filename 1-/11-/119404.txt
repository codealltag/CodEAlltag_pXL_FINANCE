BO nennt eine Gewinnschaetzung fuer 98 von 0.75 DM und fuer 99
von 1.50 DM. Das ergiebt ein  KGV von 126 fuer 98 und 63 fuer
99 bei einem Gewinnwachstum von 100%. 

Damit ist Rifata immer noch nicht billig, aber fuer einen Wachstumswert auch
nicht mehr unbedingt teuer. Obwohl ich noch etwas Luft nach unten sehe.

Zumal Rifata jetzt wohl sein Geschaeftsfeld um E*Commerce ausdehnen will.
