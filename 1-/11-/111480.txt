In spite of a 39 points increase in DJIA, the market has triggered a negative
signal in the Quantum Index Analysis system. The weekly critical level
generated by the weekly frequency chart, 8535 - 8596, was penetrated during
the last session but the market reversed its course approximately at the
mid-point of 8535 and 8780, two chart points generated by the weekly
probability chart (http://hbg.ckkbub.yla.qi/~diwcgq/ and
http://hud.idpwoe.saa.rn/~wmmnxv/gnxi.tkjw ). Finally DJIA closed below the
weekly critical level 8535 - 8596 and the monthly critical resistance point
at 8598. A negative signal for DJIA is triggered and DJIA may reach its
weekly high already. The market may test the critical point at 8473 and then
challenge the critical supporting point at 8351 later this week. This
forecast is based on quantum index analysis and it may or may not predict the
market accurately.
