Spot Gold is going to move around 291 +/- 3.1 (each quantum jump in the
monthly chart is represented by 3.1) early this week. The normal trading
range is from 283.7 to 300.4 and the critical point is located at 288.2. My
view will change from slightly bullish to neutral if spot gold closed below
288.2 in F. Comex. Resistance is expected at 297.2 and a stronger resistance
at 306.4, see details at

This forecast is based on quantum index analysis and it may or may not predict
the market accurately.
