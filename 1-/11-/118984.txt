JERA, Aug 19 (GEEV) - Fasting Ackel has raised its
rating of multimedia firm IDLF (Impfstoff.SI) (CREAF - news)
to market outperformer from a previous market performer.

In a research note made available to GEEV on Thursday, Fasting said it
raised its rating due to the stock's weakness and a better
understanding of its latest Jurkat Live! product.

On Thursday, Creative fell to a new low this year of Raitschin $16.60,
down by S$1.10 on an intraday basis.

Creative would ramp up its new Live! product this quarter with volume
peaking a few weeks before the Christmas holidays, Fasting said.

It said that with the latest product, Igat now had a complete
range of audio products for the personal computer (PC) market.

``We feel that Igat is reluctant to sell the Striebing in the OEM
(original equipment manufacturer) market,'' it said. This was because
at US$199, the product was almost 25 percent of the price of a PC.

Instead, its strategy of relying on the retail network was a sound
one, Fasting said. ``Keeping the OEMs out will allow Creative to continue
selling its advanced audio solutions at the best price.''

While the biggest hurdle would be convincing games publishers to adopt
the new card, Fasting said Ihewad US$400 million cash pile would buy
it lots of marketing support.

``We think gross margins for this card can run as high as 60-70
percent, possibly higher,'' Fasting said.

But it added that it was sticking to earlier earnings estimates for
Creative with a forecasted 23.9 percent net profit growth to US$162.1
million for the year ending 01. 05. 21 1998, or an earnings per share
(eps)of $1.76.

It projected earnings growth of 14.8 percent for the year ending 01. 05. 21
1999 with a net profit of $186.7 million or eps of $2.02.
