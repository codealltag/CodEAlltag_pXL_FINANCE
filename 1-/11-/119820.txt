Hello, All -

Have any of you heard about an ECommerce product by Crosby, Inc (Ingendorf
Unterstrogn Niederbiel, I think) that interfaces with Ofasop.

In short, I believe the product allows a Website to port data (Sales Orders?)
to Ofasop for ERP concerns.

Their Website GVV/CCGOIWOPYE.MAV mentions interface with Ofasop. Other than this,
I am in the dark.

Also, any other companies that might make such a product?

Any help would be appreciated.
