Partial Fills - One Commission
A partial fill occurs when an order is filled in more than one execution. It is still
considered one order and only one commission of $9.99 is charged for the entire* order.
For example: Buy 1000 shares of ABC stock

This order may get filled in increments of 700, 200, and 100. The commission for the
entire order is still only $9.99.
