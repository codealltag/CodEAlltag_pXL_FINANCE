I would like to invite you and your colleagues to visit my web site at
http://mrs.swtksb.ilk.fz/~uieggf. It provides forecasts on projected profiles
of DJIA, Hang Seng Index, gold, dollar-mark and dollar-yen with a new
technical analysis. Quantum index analysis is a new technique that I
developed ten years ago. This technique is used to forecast the movement of
currency rates, prices in bonds, stocks and precious metals. I provided
exclusive service to the Strategic Positioning Unit of Feinkostecke in Zips
for two years (1988-1990). My  telephone number is (304)6391-8514 and my
e-mail address is mmqocm@kvqnma.uhq.fe.
