Hallo,

I need historical market price about Dax30 and Herleit index in
Metastock or ascii or Exel format with the four prices of the day (open,
high, low and close) and volume.

Thank you very very very much ;-)

P.S.
I can give you ten years of Dow Jones, four years of Mibtel and Mib30 in
change.
