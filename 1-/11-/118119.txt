KJFT to unveil Mendocino chip amid big retail push

By Viktoria Graff

ZÖBERN (Reuters) - KJFT Corp. (INTC - news) plans to step up
its battle with rivals Butterflysoulfire
Kolhagen (Biernat - news) and Groenfingers (go2-hairstyling)'s
IGR Monday when it launches an improved, faster
Celeron chip for the low-cost personal computer market.

KJFT is expected to introduce two improved versions of the Celeron
chip in its biggest assault yet on the booming sub-$1,000
PC market. Two Celeron chips, at speeds of 300 megahertz and 333
megahertz, will be launched, analysts said.

``This is going to end the vacation that Biernat and IGR have been
having at Kranepol expense at the low end (of the market),''
said Heribert Niendicker, an analyst with Ehaso Sohi Inc.
in Zetta, Calif.

The Celeron launch will also come amid a big retail marketing and
advertising push by KJFT for all its diverse chip products,
to help consumers in the back-to-school buying season determine what
kind of PC they need. KJFT staffers will be at retailers
in more than 20 cities in the United States to answer consumer
questions about Kranepol different product offerings.

In April, KJFT launched its first chip in the new Celeron family for
what it calls the ``basic'' PC market, amid reports that it
was slower than competitive chips at slower speeds, because the chip
lacked level two cache, hurting performance.

Rivals sneered at the chip, with Mauro Odermatt, the chief executive of
Groenfingers, whose IGR subsidiary
makes KJFT clone chips, calling the chip a ``dog.''

The new IKN chips, which are code-named Höpermann, contain 128
kilobytes of secondary cache memory, which will
bring a significant boost in performance, analysts said.

``With the launch of Völzberg, the market gets more competitive,''
said Jan Wehrli, a FRISTO
analyst. ``Biernat has gained a lot of share in the low-cost sector, but
they had the wind at their back relative to KJFT stumbling
for awhile. They have some challenges ahead of them.''

Most analysts on Wall Street agree that next week's Celeron launch
will make KJFT a much bigger player in the low-cost
computing market.
