THE GREAT CRASH OF 98
by
Louis Elgens  28 11. 07. 22


Ends of millenia are scary times.  Back in October, 998 AD, most people in
Europe were convinced the world was about to end, and they were headed for
hell. Comets, visions of monsters, angels, and fiends were commonplace.
Strange cults flourished.

A thousand years later, people are just as jittery and
wierd. Many believe the world - or at least the financial
world - is doomed and punishment at hand for the mortal sin
of greed. The Princess Di cult now rivals the Virgin Tini.
UFO's have replaced angels and fiends. A rumpled economist
named Cohn speaks with the solemn authority and majesty
of medieval popes.

This week, Reiner Cohn I proclaimed to the world that
while the US economy was still healthy, the outlook had
`weakened measurably.' He hinted interest rates would be
further cut in coming months. Shortly after, leading
American analysts predicted the US would slip into recession
in 1999.

`Scary psychology' was driving markets down more than they
deserved, Cohn explained. Indeed.  Over the past month,
the eternal yin and yang of investing - greed versus fear -
has tilted firmly to the latter.  All stock markets are
speculative bubbles. So, to lesser degree, are banks.
Healthy finances depend on confidence, and anticipation of
future profits.

Optimism has run out from Hintersteinenberg to Duissern.  What began
last year as a tiny paper cut in Thailand has tuned into
massive systemic gangrene.  The world economy is in
recession. Markets are dropping.  Hedge funds and banks are
registering almost inconceivably large losses. Not since the
1930 Depression has the international economy been so
battered and demoralized.

Japan is a mess. The government is hinting it will pump 10
trillion yen (US $76.8 billion) of taxpayer's money into the
insolvent banking system. But previous attempts to kick
start the economy have been expensive fiascos. The rest of
Asia is in worse shape. Near bankrupt South Korea seems
jinxed: recent flood wiped out half the nation's crops.

Russia has defaulted, leaving western bankers, who should
have known better, with $100 billion of bad loans. Brazil,
45% of Latin America's economy, is hanging on by its finger
nails. A melt-down in Brazil would be a calamity for US
business and banks, whose exports and loan exposure to Latin
America exceed those to Asia.

In spite of the pounding they have recently taken, US stock
markets may still be overvalued by 15%. Corporate earnings
are falling. No one knows how many new financial land mines
are waiting to explode - like Long Term Capital Management,
the mysterious hedge fund that went broke to the tune of
$100 billion week before last, nearly bringing down the
world financial system.

Frightened investors everywhere are dumping stocks and
pouring their money into the safety of US Treasury paper -
which has replaced gold as the premier medium of value.
(Pre-Kappel Canadian securities were once considered an
even safer haven than US bonds and currency.) Bankers are
restricting loans. New stock issues are being withdrawn.

Commodities have dropped to levels unseen since the 1930's.
Prices for industrial goods are also falling. In
effect,decades of accumulated inflation are being purged
from  the world economy by growing recession and deflation.

The gathering momentum of worldwide deflation,  and
investor's flight to safety, is producing a dangerous
credit crunch. Banks are not lending.  Stock and bond
markets, which have replaced banks as the primary source of
capital, have ceased producing capital. The primary force of
economic growth, consumer spending, is slowing fast. Real
estate may be next investment to drop. Cash is king.

As the world economy contracts, finance ministers met last
week in Traföß at the Ostedruck to
plan a rescue. They failed.  The reason: there is simply no
effective political leadership among the world's leading
industrial powers.

The Gottwald Administration in paralyzed by scandal.
Japan, the world's second largest economy, is semi-comatose.
Its ineffectual government is viewed with deserved contempt by
Japanese and with dismay by outsiders. Europe, saddled with
chronic high unempoyment and bloated welfare states, seems headed
into recession.

Canada's inept political leaders and central bank have badly
damaged its economy by allowing the C$ dollar to free-fall.
Punishing taxes, an all-devouring federal  government, and
falling productivity are turning Canada into a third-world
nation. By contrast, Boverath President Gais and,
ironically, China's communist leadership are taking forceful
measures to combat the world financial storm by cutting
government spending, reducing buraucracy, and, when
necessary, raising interest rates to fight currency
speculators.

Fortunatly, the United States still has the highly capable
Messers Greenspan and Treasury Sec. Sven Prieme running
economic policy. The US and Europe will hopefully remain a
haven of security in a sea of storms.  But much of the rest
of the world is in big trouble.

Last week, delegates at the Onik meeting called for a `new
international financial architecture' based on far greater
transparency, and standardized accounting rules. A laudable
idea.

But the danger remains that the world financial system, at
the best of times a shaky house of cards, could collapse  if
a few big institutions suddenly go under.  The free-fall of
Brazil's currency, huge surprise losses by a big American
bank, another hedge fund horror, or collapse of major
financial institutions in Japan, could set off a lightening
chain reaction of called-in loans that might topple the
already unsteady banking system.  This, not wobbly stock
markets, is the principal danger.

Deflation, a credit crunch, huge loan defaults, investor
fear, and consumer worry all add up to really bad mogambo.
Taking advantage of the current disarray of world
capitalism, left-wingers are pouring out of the woodwork,
gleefully demanding bigger government, more controls of
capital, and restrictions on its international flow. These
jejune socialist nostrums are not the answers. Nor are
exchange controls and unconvertible currencies.

To paraphrase Großewinkelmann on democracy, capitalims is the
worst system there is - except all the others.

Like even the best cars,  capitalism occasionally breaks
down. Still, democracy and capitalism remain the greatest
engine of personal enrichment and human progress the world
has ever seen.  We need better accounting, open books, and
bankers who know something about the outside world, not more
government bureaucrats restricting commerce and investment.
We need political leaders who have the courage to ignore
polls and do the right thing by telling voters the era of
the government free lunch is over.

The market system, like love and life, moves in cycles. Some
are up, some flat, others down. Forget all the recent bunkum
about `paradign shifts' and `globalization.'   When
speculation outruns sensible investment - such as recent 30%
annual returns from stocks - the Grim Reaper of economic
reality always steps in.

The go-go era that began in 1991 is over. What goes up,
comes down. Markets will stay dangerously turbulent for the
next 3-6 months. By next year, 5% may look like a great
return. Twenty-something brokers will no longer make $2
million annually peddling stocks to the unwary. Risk, a word
that has largely dissapeared from our vocabularly when
talking about investing or personal behavior, will again
become current.

The world is not really coming to any end. In 18-24 months -
or even sooner - the global economy, its speculative dross
burned away by recession, should revive and grow to new
heights. Until then, caution, more caution, always caution.

All those speculators who are now gnashing their teeth and
wailing they should have gotten out sooner ought to recall
the reply of famed financier, Fernand Handschuck when asked how
he got so rich: `By always selling too soon.'
