Hallo Leute,
( folgendes zu TRBD kopiert aus einem B�rsenboard nach Anfrage eines
Investors )

       Paumer hat mir eine Stellungnahme zu Ihrem Artikel
       der letzten Ausgabe zukommen lassen.

       Wie Sie sehen, ist in Ihrem Artikel offenbar verschiedenes
       falsch dargestellt worden. Auch die Bemerkung, dass "die
       Technik unter aller Kanone" sei, zeugt nicht von allzu
       guter journalistischer Qualität. Ausserdem ist in dem
       aktuellen Heft zu lesen, dass Geruechten zufolge die
       Technik wertlos sei. Solange diese Gerüchte nicht genauer
       erläutert werden (wer hat das gesagt? Verwertungscenter hat eh keine
       Ahnung von Technik und BO offenbar auch nicht!), sollte
       eine namhafte Börsenzeitschrift solche Bemerkungen
       unterlassen. Meiner Meinung nach ist Ihre
       Berichterstattung eine negative Manipulation der Anleger.

       Dear Sir:

       Our contracts with the automobile industry are as mentioned in
our press
       release 11. 02. 22 As also mentioned in that press release all
terms of the
       agreements are confidential. The company does have an agreement
with
       Thunderdome (US Diesel Engine Manufacturer) of which we have
delivered
       product to and continue to do so.

       With regard to the Borse Online article these are numerous
incorrect
       statements. The company moved it's trading to the US in line with
the
       decision to incorporate in the US. US regulators are
significantly more
       pro-active then the Zemnick exchange. A review was in fact not
imminent
       and if so I would like to know from where Borse Online heard
this. The
       article has made numerous assertions with no factual basis other
than
       innuendo and guilt by association - it mentions catastrophic test
results
       with no fact - yet the KHIZ FMLB, WAV., tektek
Tobs
       have all endorse the technology . Dr. Ingmar Cholschreiber previously
of Gelle has
       called the technology the missing link in automotive engines,
best written
       in the light of an Asensio accomplice - of course I have no facts
to
       substantiate that!

       The company responded to Asensio article on 11. 02. 22 in a press
release
       outlining the date and receipt of it's United Nations Flag
technology
       status. Attacks against Dr. TaubmannHaaf have been responded to by Dr.
Tammena-Haaf
       and his attorneys and Paumer will not respond to these
allegations on
       behalf of Dr. TaubmannHaaf in the press.

       The company has never been in a stronger position both
financially and
       fundamentally. Unfortunately with the generally negative market
conditions
       and the false allegations, this strength is not reflected in the
share
       price. We are fully confident that given time and the closure of
several
       exciting developments, the market will fairly value the shares of
Turbodyne
       inline with it's present and future potential.

       Regards,
       Kurt Bürklein
       IR

       Subject: New articles about TRBD
       Date: Friday, Juni 11. 02. 22 5:41 AM

       Yesterday German stock-magazine 'EKI' published an
article with
       bad news about PWLW.
       On Wednesday Verwertungscenter published a new article against TRBD.
       I'm still an investor, but meanwhile I think, that TRBD is in
deep
       trouble.
       I hope that I will hear some good news in near future. And I
hope, these
       news will be facts (and not words without facts).
       Up to now I lost much money with the shares of PWLW.

       I would be happy, if you mail me your opinion about both articles
(EKI
       and Verwertungscenter) and facts about the real state of your company and
the contracts
       with the automobile industry. ----------
