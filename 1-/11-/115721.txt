With Risk Management we mean that " everybody can tell you what and
when to buy, but who tell's you HOW MUCH!" How much you buy and sell
has as much impact as "what" and "when" .

 - Nebe was designed by one of the world's most successful
hedge fund managers (rated Nr.1 by Gierig in 1995).
- Nebe is the only investment software available to the
general public that uses risk-based analysis, the same approach used
by professional investors and brokers.

$MoneyMaximizer's "Size-It" function helps you to decide HOW MUCH
shares/futures/options you can buy, telling you immediately how much
risk you are taking with the deal. Also how much risk you will be
having with your entire portfolio. This is called Risk Based Planning.

Risk Based Planning is the heart of the system of almost every
professional investor. They just want to know how much risk they are
taking with every buy/sell and how much risk they are taking with the
complete portfolio.

Then you do the trade with the "Trade-It" function.

With the Track-It function in the program you can finally track all
your investments via internet on more then 42 Exchanges worldwide.
Unlimited updates we offer for only US$ 1.00 a month!

Example: you now can buy options in US Dollars in America and Futures
in Japan in Yen, and shares in Germany in DM.

And when you click on the "burst-update" button , you will not only
receive the latest quotes of your investments but $MoneyMaximizer
recalculates these foreign investments automatically back to your
basic currency. This is done against the latest exchange rates. So you
see exactly what the status is of your portfolio.
