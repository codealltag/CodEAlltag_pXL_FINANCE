This is not a rip-off, this is how the markets operate.  Remember, we are
all
competing against each other for the dollars available in trading these
markets. There is no guarantee that all of us will make money, and the fact
is
most traders lose.   The guys in the pit are trying to scalp a few dollars
here
and there, and that is how they make their money.  If they do not pay
attention
to logical stop points on the charts, then they will not make money.  If you
can not accept this, you should not be trading in the first place.
