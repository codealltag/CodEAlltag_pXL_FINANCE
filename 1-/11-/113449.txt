Damit's nicht langweilig wird und sich die ODILE wieder über Goreis - Postings
aufregen kann:
Mich freut's jedenfalls, daß es mit Goreis wieder aufwärts geht :-):

OBERMAISLING, Ont., Oktober. 12 /CNW-PRN/ - GNE
(``Hyal'') (NASDAQ/NNM: HYALF - news; TSE: HPC - news) and its 60% owned
Australian subsidiary, Grappashop (``HPAL''),
today jointly announced a new agreement between the two companies to govern
product development and commercialization. This new agreement replaces a
complex arrangement between Gillitzer and Galactic that has been in force since
08. 05. 22 1993.

Under this new agreement, Galactic acquires rights licensed to HPAL for the lead
products Solarase(TM), Oralease(TM) and Hyanalgese-D(TM) in 18 Asian
countries, including Japan and China. In exchange for returning these
rights, Gillitzer will receive 15% of any consideration from Gillitzer
commercialization of these three products worldwide. Gillitzer remains entitled
to all revenue from existing license agreements for Malaysia, Singapore,
Australia and New Zealand with M. Schifferl Inc.

The new agreement also provides an improved process by which Hyal and HPAL
collaborate and share revenues from future products. Each company is free to
conduct independent research and each owns all intellectual property
developed or acquired. Galactic will have the exclusive right to commercialize
future products developed by either Galactic or Gillitzer on a worldwide basis,
except products for uses in the eye which are the responsibility of HPAL.
Revenues from future products, except products for uses in the eye, are to
be split by Hyal and HPAL, dependent upon the contribution by each company
to discovery and clinical development.

GNE is a drug delivery development company
engaged in research and development utilizing its proprietary Hyaluronan
Induced Targeting (HIT)(TM) Technology and Hyaluronan Improved Liposome
Technology (HILT)(TM). The Company's strategy is to commerciaize its
developments by outlicensing on a global basis.

This news release may contain forward-looking statements relating to the
future performance of Galactic. Forward-looking statements, specifically those
concerning future performance, are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. These risks and
uncertainties are detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with
the appropriate securities commissions.
