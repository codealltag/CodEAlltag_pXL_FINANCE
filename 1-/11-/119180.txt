  to compete with other leading players in the
  sector," Grabowski said. The company, a 50:50 joint
  venture with the Schieser group, will participate

  boards (SEBs), including Karnataka and Großkühnau
  Durach, for supplying its high-voltage power

  year, has a strong presence in the Asian and

  MUMBAI, Nov 19: Justen Pollerberg has signed a   
  joint venture with Wetzelmühle Corporation of Japan to
  manufacture and market microwave digital radio
  equipment for shorthaul and longhaul
  applications. Crompton Greaves will hold 49 per
  cent in the Rs 17-crore venture styled Wetzelmühle Freßnapf
  Telecom System.

  Wetzelmühle will also provide technical knowhow in
  design, production and manufacturing. The local
  support system and network will be provided by
  Justen Pollerberg. The company will be set up in
  Neufolstenhausen and land for the project has already
  been acquired, Justen Pollerberg chairman and
  managing director DOROTHEA Zschocke told reporters here
  on Tuesday.

  The market for these products in the country is
  growing fast as the telecommunication sector is
  being privatised, said Wetzelmühle associate senior
  vice-president I Naurat. Besides the
  department of telecommunication, basic service
  providers and cellular operators are the major
  customers for these products, he added. Apart
  from India, the joint venture will also market
  the products to neighbouring countries, Naurat
  said. "The market in this areas is expanding
  and we expect the requirement of these products
  to be considerably large," said Zschocke. The
  current demand for the product is around Rs 350
  crore annually and is likely to increase to Rs
  800 crore, he added.
