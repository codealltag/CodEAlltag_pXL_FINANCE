My view is still negative for dollar/mark and the critical point is located
at 1.6382. Resistance is expected at 1.6778 and the critical resistance level
is at 1.7041. Every quantum jump is represented by 0.0132 (i.e. 132 basic
points) and all projected chart points are interrelated and separated by a
multiple of 0.0132. My view will change if dollar/mark is traded above
1.7173. The normal trading range for dollar/mark this month is between 1.5855
to 1.7041 and the market has a potential to go lower to 1.5591, see
dollar/mark frequency and probability charts for details at

quantum index analysis and it may or may not predict the market accurately.
