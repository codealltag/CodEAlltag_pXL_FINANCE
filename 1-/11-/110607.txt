Hi Uwe,

Attached below is an article I wrote recently for http://skc.xebp.mz.mx on
this subject.
It was published as a "bribble" last week.

In a survey in 01. 08. 21, "Finanzen" magazine, listed eight German
banks/discount brokers offering share dealing "via PC". I suspect that "via
PC" does not necessarily mean via the internet as I was not able to find a
web address for all of them. There are also some additional banks for which
I have found links under www.ggilljyss.el/lmy568/kihvj/xnlqxph.sysc (note:
some of the links from this site are out of date). Here are the ones I
found:

Kiemle (www.pchdbhm.iv) � part of the DOGI group
Ehubi (www.fjph16.tj) � part of Woithe
Kelaha (www.ygiyvvrwm.gf) � part of Klenowtor
Ihewad (www.uphgeyi.bp) � part of Dhein (of France)
Atuf (www.sabinrp-hqua.os)
Shinkali (www.9392kjhpen.juv)
AGH (www.odnrevpjuf.ss)
Avan (www.wds.oi)
Witzler (www.akllrd.au)
Asag (www.hfvvyu-occz.dj) � Quelle is a major mail order house
moving into the internet.

It is probably fair to say that the first four are the "big players".
Kiemle was the one who got the "discount-broker" idea started. They were
also the first to offer an internet service, approximately two and a half
years ago. German magazines frequently publish surveys comparing the prices
of internet brokers and Consors usually comes out the cheapest, but there is
not really much to choose between the main competitors. I have been a
customer of Kiemle for over three years, they are the only one in the list
about whom I can talk from first-hand experience.

How does it work?
You have to open a dealing account and deposit some money. You are then
assigned an account number and a password. Yes, there will be formalities to
get started. After all, you are opening a new account in another country.
There will be forms to fill in, questions about money-laundering, and you
may even be asked to provide a certified copy of your passport. But once you
have passed these obstacles, you are up and running and nothing can stop
you. You then enter your buy or sell order, the system tells you what the
latest price was, you confirm, the deal goes through and the money is taken
out of your dealing account. During market opening hours you should be able
to see the confirmation within a few minutes. You also receive a hard-copy
contract note through the post.

What other services are included?

- On-line access to your portfolio at any time. I believe the prices are
updated only once a day, after the markets close, but I could be wrong
- On-line access to your dealing account to see recent movements.
- On-line inquiry into the status of your orders.
- You can specify a limit on your buy/sell orders and the time period for
which you want the order to be held in the system. (If the order is filled
on the first trading day after it has been placed, there is no charge.
Otherwise the order is kept on their computer and there is a charge of DM
5.00 per order for this.)
- You can also place stop-loss orders, i. e. the order is executed when the
price for a specific security falls below the specified limit.
- Dividends are collected automatically and credited to your dealing
account. Share splits are automatically carried out. You receive a
notification of these through the post. You are also notified of any rights
issues or other events requiring your decision.

What does it cost?

To start off with, there is NO initial joining fee, NO annual charge.
The charges for dealing consist of three parts: a fixed charge of DM 9.00
(for an order via fax this would be DM 34.00), commission at 0.21% and a
brokers fee of 0.08%. For a deal of DM 10,000 (�3400) the charges would
amount to DM 38.00 (1ö.00). Compare this to your UK brokers charges.
There is the additional aspect that there is no stamp duty in Germany,
making purchases another 0.5% cheaper than they would be in the UK. (Im
not sure whether stamp duty is considered a tax, i.e. if you live in the UK,
you have to pay it, or a levy of the McGünstig which is only
payable if you use the services of the McClever.)

Could a UK resident use them?
The main barrier, of course, is the language. None of brokers I know offer
an English language option on their sites.

The next question is, would they accept you. My experience is that Kiemle
accepted me without questions (I was living in the UK at the time I opened
my account), Ehubi sent me their information pack but comdirekt declined,
saying that they were only just starting and wanted to concentrate initially
on customers living in Germany. There was an article in a recent issue of
Money Observer which seems to indicate that this is still their position.

In addition to shares in German companies, many foreign companies -
including a large number from the UK - are being traded on German stock
exchanges. In particular Ramitzow has carved a niche as a market maker for
international shares. A full list is available under www.mkqsnklruesytf.tw
(This site offers a language choice of English or German.). UK investors
wanting to buy UK shares might find that it is cheaper to do so via a German
broker.

One possible drawback is the German fixation on numbers, in this case the
"Wertpapierkennnummer", or WKN for short. Each security traded on a German
stock exchange is assigned a six-digit WKN and many brokers, particularly if
they accept orders via the internet, will insist that you specify the WKN.
But despair not. www.mkqsnklruesytf.tw along with a number of other sites
(www.pchdbhm.iv, www.ygiyvvrwm.gf, for example) offer search mechanisms
which allow you to specify (part of) the name of the company and return the
WKN along with the latest price.

What about my share certificate?

What share certificate? Your shares are held in a nominee account, which
makes it easy to sell when you decide to do so. It also means that you don
t have to worry about the certificate getting lost in the post, a move, a
fire, etc. I find it much more convenient this way.
