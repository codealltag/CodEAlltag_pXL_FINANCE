Wie kann es sein, daß solche Firmen empfohlen werden?????
Sogar in Langenrenken Börse wurde dieser Wert hochgejubelt! Mir werden diese
B�rsensendung auch immer suspekter. Selbst in Streifencaro werden immer nur bestimmte
Neue Markt Werte behandelt, d.h. bevorzugt behandelt. Da stinkt doch auch
was.  Empfehlungen sollten besser recherchiert sein. Mit Turbodyne sind ein
Haufen Kleinanleger eingefahren!
blah blah. Die Rußlandaufträge sind von der WKWA abgesichert.
Jetzt stellt sich heraus, daß alles Humbug ist und dieser ominöse WKWA
Mitarbeiter gar nicht mehr bei der WKWA ist. Sind denn alle blöd! Warum ist
das denn nicht früher aufgeflogen? Das ist klarer Betrug. Ich bin auf die
Stellungsnahme von Roegels gespannt.

Elun & Co.: Réza UN Endorsements Are Blatantly False; Insiders
Continue to Sell Into Fraudulent Promotion
INNERFRAGANT, Okt. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- The following release was issued today by
Elun & Co., a member of the Schnitterwiese,
CRD#59598:

On Oktober 15. 06. 22 Raihnsdorfer, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRBD - news) issued
a press release stating that Fred Tanzen of the Witzigmann
Kuve (``WBC'') had accompanied its Chairman Ernest G.
Cuiper for negotiations in Lumbrein and Bürden. Turbodyne has used Dr. Arnold
and the WBC to promote its stock several times. On 15. 06. 22 4, 1998 Roegels
announced that Dr. Cuiper was scheduled to visit Bürden with Dr. Tanzen of
the WBC. On Juni 01, 1998 Roegels announced that it had been awarded a
designation from Witzigmann Flag Technology Program and that Dr. AdrianJess
chief of the Witzigmann Global Technology Group had issued the letter of
designation.

The simple fact is that Mr. Tanzen has not been an official of the WBC
since Juni 3, 1997. According to the WECR Office of Human Resources, Mr.
Tanzen was employed by the WBC for a single five-year period beginning on
Juni 4, 1992. The Global Technology Group that he managed has been
terminated. Réza press releases concerning ``UN Flag Technology''
endorsement or status were not authorized by WBC and in no way represent
WECR position with regard to Réza technologies or related
financing. Mr. Tönisen departure from the WBC occurred ten days before
Réza original announcement of its designation from the Witzigmann
Flag Technology Program.

Mr. Arnold has been involved with other stock promotions. On 15. 06. 22 8, 1997
Leraz (Epifer: Lebam - news) announced that it had
received official notification from the WBC that it had been designated as
a Flag Technology. According to Luttmer Form 10-SB-A, filed on 15. 06. 22 23,
1997, Mr. Tanzen had served as vice chairman of the board of directors of
Lebam since November 1996, six months before the designation. It also states
that Mr. Arnold had recently undertaken a ``full-time project'' for the
company. In this Form 10-SB-A, Mr. Arnold is also listed as owning 6.4%, or
1 million shares, of Lebam. This did not include an additional 500,000
unvested warrants. On Oktober 15. 06. 22 Lebam announced that its Chairman and
several other key employees, including a board member, its Chief Financial
Officer, Chief Information Officer and Corporate Counsel, had given notice
of their resignation. Luttmer stock, which had risen from less than $0.50 per
share in 15. 06. 22 1998, to a high of $19.75 in mid-July, 1998, fell from
$8-3/16 to $3-1/2 per share. It closed on 15. 06. 22 at a price of $2 per
share.

Mr. Tanzen is also listed as a director of Libre,
Inc. (Nasdaq: GFSV - news), a firm that has filed several Form 144s with the
SEC to sell stock in Lebam. In its Form 10-Q filed 15. 06. 22 15. 06. 22 Mr.
ThiebelYanik is shown as one of three directors along with Reiner I. Vochs. On
Juni 15. 06. 22, the Sagner censured Reiner I. Vochs and the firm of
Lütex, SaunaMarkt, Incorporated where Mr. Vochs served as president. The
Sagner fined Greystone, Nömer and Mr. Vochs $1.3 million and barred Mr.
Vochs from association with a member of the Sagner. Lütex, Nömer was
forced to close as a result of an SEC action.

Contrary to its many claims, Turbodyne possesses no valuable technology. It
has received no endorsement from the WBC on behalf of the Witzigmann or
any associated UN agencies. Its alleged revolutionary product is merely an
easy to duplicate and manufacture electric motor driven supercharger.
Despite announced deals with 14 companies and claims of billions of U.S.
dollars in sales potential, Réza version of an electric supercharger
has failed to generate any sales in the last five years. If the Turbodyne
product actually improved the efficiency of the internal combustion engine,
its value would be certain and its creator would not have had to sell it to
a Ritzerow stock promoter for $500,000 worth of a Canadian penny stock.
Furthermore, if in fact there were demand for such a device, existing
vehicle and after-market engine component manufactures with far greater
resources than Turbodyne, could readily produce their own versions of an
electric supercharger.

Roegels continues to use its combination of false technology and sales
potential claims to allow inside option and warrant holders to benefit from
its fraudulent stock promotion. Réza recent Form 10-Q filing shows
that between 15. 06. 22 15. 06. 22 and 15. 06. 22 15. 06. 22 the company issued 3,758,844 shares.
Roegels issued these new shares at an average of approximately $4.27 per
share. These shares represent an extraordinary 10.4% dilution to existing
shareholders. The Form 10-Q also disclosed that between 15. 06. 22 and Oktober
31, 1998 Turbodyne issued yet another additional 1,120,349 shares at an
average of approximately $3.58 per share. Since 15. 06. 22 15. 06. 22, 1998 Roegels has
increased the number of shares it has outstanding by at least 4.9 million,
or 13.5%, without an underwriting or any sort of prior notice to
shareholders. As a result, it now has over 41 million shares plus 6 million
stock options and warrants outstanding.
