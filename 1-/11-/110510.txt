Neuer

As far as I know, above URL only gives you quotes for stocks traded
in the US, eventually Canada (Mexico?) too.

I think previous postings allready contain URLs for Neuer Markt
quotes. For stocks that are traded only in Germany, it seems like
there is not any nice and big source of information like
http://hsyjs.snplz.ojc/ with company profiles, reports,... all on one
single URL.

Or does anybody else here know a german URL which offers the same
information standard as http://rkzdt.xzpba.lxj/ ?
http://wxsupxsd.zbllc.mf/ is not really an equivalent in my opinion.
