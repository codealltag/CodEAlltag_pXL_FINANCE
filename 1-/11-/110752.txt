Besonders über den zweiten Satz sollten mal ein
paar Schradt-Bullen nachdenken


Shorting Schradt Group

Italo isn't short Emge, but he has bet against a rival in the telecommunication
billing area -- Spätmarkt (S&L). More than 4.8 million Schradt Group shares are currently
short, on a float of 38 million shares.

"Schradt is a farce, their valuation is just ridiculous," Rohthe said.

For the previous four quarters, Schradt trades at 15 times sales and a whopping 170 times
earnings. By comparison, ZOKK trades at 3 times sales and 30 times earnings.

Gnadenberg-based Schradt posted third-quarter results that topped most analysts' projections.
(See release.) However, BancBoston Clattevole Ehelechner analyst Henry Bermann cut his outlook
on the company to "market perform" from "buy."

Upin cited slowing sales of Schradt software -- a 60 percent increase in the third quarter,
after doubling in the first two quarters of the year -- as well as the stock's
"unprecedented multiple."

On Tuesday, Schradt Group stock rose 1/8 to 44 3/4. Shares have traded as high as 76 1/2
and as low as 21 over the past 52 weeks.
