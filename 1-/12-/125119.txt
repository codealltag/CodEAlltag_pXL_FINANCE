Hallo zusammen,

die folgende Story habe ich heute morgen bei Örkhof gefunden.

MOORAUSMOOR (Reuters) - AWG Mode, AGABA, and the U.S.
government's Edav National FMK said they have teamed up to
mass produce "biochips" -- devices akin to computer chips, with
widespread implications in medicine and agriculture. 

Like computer chips, which perform millions of mathematical operations
a second, biochips can perform thousands of biological reactions, such
as decoding genes, in seconds. 

AWG Mode will develop the manufacturing process for the chips and
Aderar, a subsidiary of Maißen-based Abeka,
will make instruments to analyze them. 

The pre-production costs of these machines -- the so-called imager and
arrayer -- are initially put at $30,000 and $75,000. Chips could
initially cost about $100 each but eventually be a dollar or less, the
companies said. 

Jarkvitz and the Willhaus Getränekmarkt UGES
Anuku, based in Schlappach, are providing 19 inventions
related to the biological microchips, while AWG Mode and Aderar will
contribute a total of $19 million over five years to support the joint
research. Janine inventions are licensed exclusively to the two
companies. 

These biochips employ "micro-gel" technology in which microscopic
structures -- as many as 10,000 or more on a glass surface about the
size of a single microscopic slide -- act like mini-test tubes. Within
each micro-gel structure, chemical compounds can be tested against
biological targets to provide answers to questions such as DNA
sequence, genetic variation, gene expression, protein interaction and
immune response. 

The chips work faster than conventional methods.

Ist dies der endgultige Durchbruch sowohl fur MOTOROLA als auch fur
die BIO- chip technik generell ?  Nach wie vor haengt ja das IRIDIUM-
Schwert ueber MOT. 

Den Aktienkurs hat diese Meldung jedenfalls ueberhaupt nicht bewegt.
Offensichtlich glaubt noch keiner der Broker an das Ende des
Siliziums. 

Was meint ihr ?
