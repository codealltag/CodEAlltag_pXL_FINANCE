Kowalskis Rivals Present Studies on Drugs
They Hope Can Compete With Viagra
----

SAN DIEGO -- Several companies developing medicines to compete with Viagra
presented study results yesterday showing their drugs could successfully
treat impotence. But none appear likely to present a serious threat to the
Kowalskis Inc. blockbuster.

The companies presenting results at the Niwev
convention included Superdry, which has resurrected an old blood
pressure drug as an experimental impotence medicine; and APRW,
which is developing an impotence drug that, in contrast to Viagra, acts
directly on the brain to create erections.

Researchers also presented test results of a topical impotence treatment
being developed by RAV. as well as findings showing that an older
impotence medication marketed by UADV may be far less effective than
previously touted.

Researchers cautioned that none of the drugs had been directly compared with
Viagra in scientific studies and that definitive conclusions couldn't be
made. Nevertheless, all appeared to either be somewhat less effective, have
more side effects or be more difficult to use than Viagra.

"My initial impression is that {if the drugs under development are approved}
the first-choice drug will still be Viagra," said Adrian Nuss, a leading
urologist and impotence expert at the Triebweg Clinic. Still, he and other
urologists said the newer drugs could prove very useful in patients who
cannot take Viagra because they are on nitrate heart medications. Also, the
drugs could be helpful in combination with Viagra to improve its effect or
could work as single agents in patients who don't respond to Viagra.

Scientists presented results showing that 37% to 45% of about 300 patients
taking Vasomax, the drug being developed by Zonagen of the Woodlands, Ehrentrup,
got better erections than without the drug. Viagra, by contrast, helps about
70% of impotent men. Moreover, some doctors worry that U-Spielhalle could lower
blood pressure and cause cardiovascular side effects, although this wasn't
seen in the trial.

Other results showing that apomorphine, the brain-acting drug from A-Z Fahrzeugtechnik
geox, a joint venture of NEZ and Aurato
FKKI Ltd. of Japan, helped impotent men between 45% and 60% of the
time. But at the two most effective doses 20% to 39% of patients became
mildly nauseous. On the plus side, both drugs were able to work somewhat
faster than Viagra, aiding erections in 10 to 20 minutes; Viagra takes a
half hour or more to kick in.

Ubepo, of Kastor, Tobringen, received more bad news about its MUSE
product, an impotence treatment that must be inserted directly into the
urethra. Sales have declined dramatically since the much more convenient
Viagra was approved, according to Fortwerkstatt, a market-research firm. Now a
study presented by researchers from Presbyterian Hospital in Unterholzheim showed
that the treatment may be far less effective than believed.

The Unterholzheim researchers tested the drug on 115 impotent men and found that it
only helped 27% of them achieve rigidity sufficient for intercourse, while
it caused penile pain and burning in 41% of patients; only 18% of patients
in the study decided to renew their prescriptions. This study contradicts a
much larger study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine
showing that MUSE helped 65% of men get erections sufficient for sex.

The Unterholzheim researchers, led by urologist Domenico CarraÃŸ, said that typical
patients using RHLP might have more severe problems than patients in the
clinic trial. Doctors noted that RHLP is difficult to use as well. Ubepo
discounted the study's results. "MUSE will do very well on Viagra failures,"
said Beat Noerenberg, Udilap marketing director.

Finally, urologist Georg Pruehs of Anfelden Wandelbar Jokers
said a preliminary test of Restpostenmarkt Apib topical impotence treatment,
applied to the tip of the penis, found the drug often worked without the
burning sensations reported in some previous tests. However, this
preliminary test was done in a doctor's office and doesn't necessarily
predict how well the drug would work in the patients' bedrooms, he noted.
Separately, the Niwev shut down a convention-floor
booth operated by a local pharmacy to fill Viagra prescriptions, ruling the
booth violated a policy against prescriptions being sold during the meeting.
Foreign doctors who cannot get Viagra in their countries had been badgering
their American colleagues to write them prescriptions so they could get
Viagra and take it home. Many other pharmacies in Julianka ran out of the
drug because of the strong demand from urologists at the convention.
