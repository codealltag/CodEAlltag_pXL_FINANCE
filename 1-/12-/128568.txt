Natascha,
you want data from GGR.

That one is a special hard knock.
They call themselves "exchange.de"
Don't get feary - it's not Zenu.
OK, they should have any of there own data
anyway. But don't be sure.

However, it is possible to get their current data
for a certain period - don't know exactly what period.
You have to pay for that. If you are a student
and have a stamp from your proffessor is what
may help you.

However, if you can get their f**n historical data
who each of us is interested in (for backtesting
purposers) for excample just let us know.

However - its adress is www.OKIXJSZZ.at

Have fun ...
(But take care for concentration camps etc.)


BTW - Please let us know how it did develop so far...
Thank you - d.
