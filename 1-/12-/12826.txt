Poker Tells Tactics
From "The Doc" Sangmeister

Let's continue this series
of columns in which
I get to both ask the
questions and answer
them. By doing it this way,
you'll be happy, because I'm
fully prepared to respond.
And I'll be happy, because
nobody will embarrass me
with off-topic questions
about boxers or briefs. By
the way, the answer to that
one is whichever I happen
to grab first when I blindly
reach into the drawer. I get
asked that literally hundredths
of times every year.
You're right; I didn't say
"hundreds."
We've dealt with 15
questions so far. Today
we examine poker tactics
involving aces before and
on the flop in hold'em.
Question #16: What
exactly is a poker tactic?
I'm not sure. Some people
insist, probably correctly,
that there's a big difference
between a strategy and a tactic.
A strategy is an encompassing,
usually long-term,
plan to achieve a favorable
goal. A tactic is a single
method for accomplishing
a specific immediate objective.
You could quibble with
that definition, and some
readers probably will

Until recent years, I've
pretty much used the terms
"strategy" and "tactic" interchangeably.
My bad. Today,
when we handle questions
about hold'em tactics with
aces, we're yielding to the
vocabulary police and talking
only about decisions we
make in quest of quick success
in the course of a poker
hand.
Question 17: When
you're in early position
with aces before the flop,
how do you decide whether
to raise or just call?
A lot of experts advise
that you should randomize,
so that astute opponents
won't be able to predict
how you play. That's not
bad advice, but it's unlikely
that many opponents will
ever be able to predict how
you play aces, based on
past performance. That's
because you only get a pair
of aces in an early position
about once in 20 hours, on
average. Unless opponents
play against you regularly
for a long period of time,
it's doubtful that they'll be
very confident about how
you play aces early, even if
you do the same thing every
time.
Still, it probably doesn't
hurt to mix up your play and
raise about twice for every
one time that you just call.
Fortunately, there are better
ways to choose a tactic
rather than just randomizing.
I always begin with
a standard tactic and make
exceptions. My usual decision
is to raise the required
double-the-big-blind amount
in a limit hold'em game and
to raise a little more than
the minimum in a no-limit
game. For instance, if it's no
limit and the blinds are $100
small and $200 big, then
I'll tend to raise to $450 or
$500 under the gun holding
aces.
Fine. But when do I vary
from this? If a lot of players
waiting to act are very
loose, I'll often just call and
invite them into the pot.
While some players believe
you want to protect aces by
chasing players out of the
pot, that doesn't turn out to
be the best choice. Aces are
your biggest profit maker
by far. And they usually
make the most money when
competing against up to
four opponents. Yes, you'll
lose more often, but overall
you'll make more money.
And that's what matters.
Also, I'll regularly just
call if very aggressive opponents
are immediately to
my left. What I'm hoping
for is that they'll raise and
other players will call. Then,
when it gets back to me I
can re-raise. In a no-limit
game, I'll seldom move all
in at this point, but I will
make a substantial reraise--
large enough that I'm hoping
to be called.
If aggressive players are
in late positions and loose
players are between us, I'll
sometimes just call, too,
hoping one of the late players
will raise. If that happens,
I'll usually just call to
make the loose players feel
comfortable calling behind
me. I seldom want to chase
those players out.
Sometimes if I just call
and only one player competes
by raising, I'll just call

again. I especially like this
tactic if the raiser is aggressive.
Then I'll usually try
for a check-raise on the flop.
The secret to knowing
how to play aces from an
early position is to survey
the opponents waiting to
act. If they're either very
loose or very aggressive--
or both--I tend to just call.
Otherwise I routinely raise.
If you do it that way, you'll
increase your long-range
profit beyond what you'd
earn by just mixing up your
decisions at random.
Question #18: What
should you do if you flop a
pair of aces and see three
suited cards on board?
Usually, it's a mistake to
play aces timidly when three
suited cards flop. If you
hold Af Qa and the flop
comes Ad10d4d your
main risks are that someone
holds ace-king or flopped
a flush, but you shouldn't
check in deference to those
fears. Why? It's because
there's a much more likely
disaster that confronts you.
That potential tragedy centers
on a player having just
one more card matching the
suit on board and making a
flush on the turn or river.
By betting aggressively--
the required amount in a
limit game or a substantial
bet, but not so big that you
can't fold to a raise in a
no-limit game--you often
chase away opponents with
low-ranking flush cards.
That's exactly what you
want to do. They frequently
fold these small ranks
because they fear that someone
else will hold a larger
flush even if they connect.
The second reason that you
should bet is that you want
to charge your opponents a
price for their flush attempt.
You don't want them to get
perfect odds by seeing if
they can connect for free.
This advice may seem
obvious, but you'll see
players--even sophisticated
ones--check routinely in
this situation. When you
flop aces with a big kicker
and see three suited cards
on board, you should almost
always bet (or raise) unless
there are compelling reasons
to do otherwise.
I've got to go. As I
matured, I changed from a
typical selfish, irresponsible
poker pro to a man with
duties and obligations. So,
I've got to tend to my dog
now. It's Wednesday--time
