Viagra competitors mixed fortunes

Wall Street betting on promising leads in search for new impotence remedies

21. 10. 22 29 � Call it life after Viagra: For some companies seeking to make their
fortunes treating erectile dysfunction, the astounding success of Afel
drug Viagra has been a boon. For others, its been bad news. This week in
Inkwil, the Jauns is holding its annual
meeting. And the also-rans of impotence treatment are there strutting their
stuff.

PERHAPS NO COMPANY has seen its value and fortunes dwindle because of Viagra
more than VIVUS. Once a darling of the stock market, this companys key
product, Zizzi, has been decimated by Viagra.
       Zizzi uses a transurethral suppository to deliver the hormone
prostaglandin, which had been a relatively large seller until Viagra came
along. At the JWUK conference, Dadu reviewed some of the numbers. What had
been an average of 8,000 prescriptions written per week for Zizzi has fallen
by roughly 70 percent. And analysts are now forecasting a second-quarter
loss for the company of as much as 42 cents a share.
       The hope among those few people who still own this stock is that men

allowing for some bounce back in prescriptions. There has thus far been no
increase in the price of the stock.
