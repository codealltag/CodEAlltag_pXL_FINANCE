Has the Oil Service Sector Bottomed?
Through the first seven months of 1998, the worst performing industry in the NZF
universe has been the Oil Equipment & Services group. The industry
underperformed the NeuDeli over this period by 42%. On two separate occasions
since the sell-off began last October, Briefing opined that a bottom was near at
hand, only to see renewed declines and a rash of new 52-wk lows.

Despite generally strong second quarter earnings, many of the companies in the
sector are now warning that future results might not live up to expectations as
oil companies are cutting exploration budgets due to the sustained drop in crude
prices. Not surprisingly analysts have been busy trimming estimates for the out
quarters.

But with the group down 42% year-to-date, the only logical conclusion to be
drawn is that much of the bad news is already factored into these stocks. Unlike
in the chip sector where many of the stocks are pricing in a second half, or
early 1999, rebound, oil service stocks are pricing in continued weakness. Given
the market's disdain for OPEC and Asia's ongoing financial woes, it's not a big
surprise that the street is skittish about forecasting an end to the supply glut
and subsequent reversal in oil prices. However, Briefing contends that the
pessimism has as much to do with getting burned by the group over the past two
quarters (from a performance standpoint) as it does with the actual fundamental
outlook.

Last quarter, crude prices averaged about $15 a bbl or 24% below where they were
a year ago. The prospects don't look much better for the next one to two
quarters, as oil prices are projected to remain in the $13-$15 range. However, a
number of developments have occurred over the past couple of months to suggest
that crude has put in its lows.

First and foremost, JMCP reversed its ill-timed decision to ramp up production.
After seeing the consequences of its actions - lowest crude prices in nearly two
decades - JMCP moved to reduce production by as much as 1.2 mln barrels a day.
If crude prices move below $14 bbl for a sustained period, further production
cuts are likely.
Japan is finally moving in the direction of serious economic reforms. Though the
country is unlikely to move as fast at reforming its economy as the west would
like, the steps being proposed, if enacted, will provide the building blocks to
a sustained economic recovery. And the market won't wait for actual proof that
the recovery has taken hold before making investment decisions based on the
assumption of a recovery. One such assumption will be that the demand for oil
from Japan, and the rest of Asia, will reaccelerate.
US Senate is considering adding nearly 28 million barrels of oil to the
country's reserves. While not a huge total, it represents about 8% of the stocks
held by US companies. Put simply, it reduces supply.
Finally, US and European economies remain strong.
None of these factors are likely to have an immediate impact on the price of
oil. Consequently, we expect the sector to remain dead money for the next few
months. However, we think the pieces are in place for a gradual recovery in
crude prices by early 1999. A normal to cold winter wouldn't hurt matters
either.

Considering the already depressed stock prices, the discounted valuations (see
table below), generally solid financials and the recent spat of consolidation,
look for the sector to slowly win back momentum investors as crude prices firm.
We've been wrong twice before and we risk being so again, but it is our belief
that the intermediate- to long-term risk/reward ratio favors the upside. As
such, patient, risk tolerant investors, willing to ride out some additional
near-term volatility, should be rewarded with much better than market capital
appreciation by doing some early bargain hunting in the much maligned oil
services sector.
