Poker Tells Continued
by PÃ¶tckers
In the last two columns,
I've answered
key questions about
poker concepts and
tactics. So far, we've dealt
with four topics. And today
the series will be continued
(today's word) with three
more. What's so special
about those questions?
Okay, I'll tell you what's
so special--I get to ask
them. When I do interviews,
I'm at the mercy of the
reporter. Some questions
are prescient, but others are
lame. Of course, it doesn't
stop me from rambling on,
regardless of the merits of
the question. You can always
give brief acknowledgment
to the core of the question
and then use that as a springboard
into more important
stuff.
But why waste time having
to mold meaningful
answers to off-target questions.
When I pose the questions,
they're precisely what
I want to be asked--and
the responses encompass
exactly what I want to convey.
I have fun and you get
rewarded. So, let's move
along...
Question 5: You're
at the final table in a
proportional-payoff tournament.
Three players
remain. First place pays
$100,000, 2nd place pays
$50,000, and 3rd place
pays $25,000. You're in
the big blind holding
Qs. The total chips in
play amount to $300,000.
Blinds are $5,000 (small)
and $10,000 (your current
big blind). You started the
hand with $110,000 and
each of your opponents
started with $95,000. The
player in the dealer position
moves all-in and the
player in the small blind
calls. Now what?
You should immediately
fold! If you make it a threeway
scramble, it's hard to
say what your exact chances
of winning the pot are. If
you do claim the pot, you'll
win the tournament immediately.
While it depends on
the traits of the opponents,
a good guess would be that
you'd win 40 percent of
the time and each opponent
would win 30 percent of
the time. That sounds like
a great deal for you, but it
isn't.
Let's do the math. If you
play and win, you pocket
$100,000. If you play and
lose, you share half of the
total $75,000 2nd and 3rd
place money--$37,500. If
you prorate those chances,
the amount of prize money
you average by calling is
$62,500. That's better than
$58,333--one-third of the
$175,000 remaining prize
pool. So, by calling, you'll
fare better than you had
expected to prior to this
hand.

But you can do better still
by folding! If you fold,
there will be just two of you
competing for the remaining
$150,000 in prize money.
In tournament chips (which
are much different than
actual money), you'll have
$100,000 left, having surrendered
$10,000 as the big
blind. Your lone opponent
will have $200,000. For
simplicity, we'll ignore
the minor significance of
who takes the next blind.
Mathematically, your chances
of winning are pretty
much proportional to the
total chips you control. So,
you have one-third of the
chips and, thus, you should
expect to be crowned champion
in similar cases onethird
of the time.
Fine. So one-third of
the $100,000 first-place
money is $33,333.33 and
two-thirds of second-place
$50,000 is also $33,333.33.
This means that by folding,
you've increased the
theoretical value of your
cash-out to $66,667. That's
more than $4,000 earned by
folding.
In this example, you
should probably play a
pair of kings or aces, but
not queens. There are
some situations where you
shouldn't even play a pair
of aces! And, of course, we
could quibble about whether
your pair of queens will win
more or less than 40 percent
of the time--and against
some loose players, it's
correct to call. But that's
not the point. The point is
that you should often avoid
committing your chips to
a pot in the final stages of
a poker tournament when
someone else is likely to be
eliminated.
Question 6: What does
it mean when an opponent
starts to tremble when
making a wager?
A lot of ancient poker
literature had this tell backwards.
Even today, many
players instinctively come
to the wrong conclusion.
The obvious, but wrong,
answer is that players begin
to tremble when they're
nervous about making a bet.
This leads many to believe
that a shaking hand is a sign

that an opponent is probably
bluffing. This is hardly ever
the case.
When opponents bluff
or bet weak hands, they
bolster themselves. They
tend to become more rigid.
They're afraid that anything
they do that's abnormal will
make you suspicious and
invite an unwanted call.
That's why bluffers seldom
move much or say much.
Look for an artificially
stiff demeanor. You won't
often see trembling when
opponents hold weak hands;
you'll see just the opposite.
Look for robotic movements
and hands that seem
very steady, because a great
effort is made to keep from
shaking.
Release of tension
Anytime you see a bettor
who was previously composed
tremble when making
a wager, that's a release of
tension. It's a natural reaction
that occurs when the
suspense ends and a huge
hand--often a straight flush,
a big full house, four of
a kind, or an unbeatable
flush--has unexpectedly
been made. You'll save a lot
of money by simply folding
whenever you see a trembling
bet.
Those aren't the obvious
answers, but the most obvious
poker decisions aren't
always right.
