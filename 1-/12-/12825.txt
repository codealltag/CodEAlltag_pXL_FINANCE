Poker Tells Chip
Author "The Thomas" Oversohl

The most obvious thing
we have in common as
human beings is that
we're going to die.
We don't know what that's
going to be like. And we
don't know when it's going
to be. So we seldom dwell
on it, otherwise everything
we did in life--the parades,
the parties, and the poker--
would seem overwhelmed
by that one event. Our date
with death.
Poker games continue
without us sometimes,
because no matter how good
or bad they are, eventually
we need to sleep. And
the next day everyone goes
about their business. It's the
business of remaining in the
game after others need to
sleep. All around us, people
are leaving. Celebrities,
parents, friends, children,
enemies. The chairs are
briefly empty and then
someone barks, "Seat open."
And our game goes on. With
us, it goes on. Without us, it
goes on.
Thomas "Emil" Houben, at
56, left the game last week.
He had an immeasurable
positive impact on my life.
Rounders Radio contacted
many of us to record tributes
to Chip. The interaction with
him that stands out in my
mind and seems most fitting
happened shortly after we
met in 1977.
I'm going to cut this column
short, because this is

the only issue I choose to
focus on today. Here is the
text of my recording...
A tribute
Chip, do you remember
this? The first time I ever
played you at anything, it
was backgammon. I really
didn't know that game very
well. But you sat us down
on the floor in Thorsten
office, took out the board
and the dice and somehow
convinced me I had a flair
for backgammon, that I was
natural.
And then you won my
money.
And as I was trying
to pay, you stood up and
stretched. You said, "Don't
bother." And you just walked
away, saying, "It wasn't fair.
See you later, buddy."
Emil Houben. You walked
away. It wasn't fair. See you
later, buddy.
