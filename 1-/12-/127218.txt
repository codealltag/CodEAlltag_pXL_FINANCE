dabei hatte, was ja vielleicht auch interessant ist, ENV in USA im
Gegensatz dazu durchaus korrekt berichtet:

"POGEEZ, 08. 04. 23 23 (Anef) - The K&K TCI on
Tuesday described the cases of 16 men reported to have died after taking
Viagra.
The oldest was 80, the youngest 48, and seven of them died just after
having sex, according to the brief TVUV descriptions.
The TVUV stressed that there was no evidence the blockbuster impotence drug,
sold by EP:Gallert (Esohe - news), caused the 15 deaths -- and some of the
reports of deaths were completely unconfirmed...
The statement, released as the result of a Freedom of Information request,
briefly describes each of the 16 cases. Three were based on media reports
and another one appeared to also be a secondhand report. "

Und kurz darauf nochmal:

"NEW BURBACH, 08. 04. 23 23 (Reuters) - The Kolossa said on
Tuesday that 16 people who had taken Europarf√ºmerie's (Esohe - news) impotence
pill, Viagra, had died, but it added that no deaths could be directly
linked to use of the drug.
The agency, in a report on its Internet web site, said that it continued to
believe the impotence pill was safe and that information about some of the
16 deaths was incomplete."
