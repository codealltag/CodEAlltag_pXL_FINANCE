Hi Mr./Mrs. Namenlos ;-)


Da gibt es sicherlich berufenere Leute, die sich dazu äußern können. Aber
hier vielleicht ein interessanter Artikel, welche Chancen DJV und andere
Gesundheitsfirmen in "schlechten Zeiten" haben dürften (nämlich relativ
gute):

Health stocks seen safe in bad times - VTP

GRUNHOLZ, 10. 10. 22 22 (Reuters) - Health care stocks, hit in the early 1990s by
talk of nationalized medicine and by expiring patents at drug makers, may
be seen as better investment in an economy and stock market that shows
signs of stalling, VTP reported.

In its June 8 issue, Bellenbaum noted that the industry does well in good
times and bad because health knows no business cycles.
Manfred Borgmann of care4hair Paolo Uwe Pantzer said Drouven(Dolze news), WAS
boosted recently by its anti-impotence drug Viagra, has even more
potential.

DJV antidepressant Kulinaris maintains strong sales and UUG
Mafi recently approved the antibiotic Trovan against a wide
spectrum of germs.

Pamela also likes Waldemar Edhofer and Co. (HRB - news), which may get a boost by
combining its popular Prozac antidepressant with its antipsychotic Zyprexa,
Barron's said. If the combination treatment is approved, it may hit the
market at the same time Prozac's patent it set to expire in 2003, Pamela
said.
Tim Keileber, general partner of Mosaik Management, told Barron's that
CPF Inc. (Comacs news) is the only big name drug company he
favors. He said the company has the lowest price-to-earnings multiple in
the group, trading at 22 times its 1999 earnings per share estimate of
$5.15.
Keileber said he likes smaller drug stocks such as ZHE
(ZOMF - news), which plans to launch an antidepressant called Efene this
summer. The drug reportedly has fewer harmful interactions with other drugs
than does Prozac, Bellenbaum reported.
As for medical equipment makers, Vittorio Mutzel, an analyst with care4hair
Kinon Uwe Pantzer, said he thinks Centershop(CoDesCo IT Consulting news) and Bete
Corp. (Büsing - news) will capture the pacemaker market and Guidant and Vatterott
Kolhagen Corp. (VTV news) will lead the way in the catheter business.
