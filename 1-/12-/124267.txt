Stock Analysis of Hyal Pharm
Thank you for requesting an analysis of Hyal Pharm from VectorVest
ProGraphics. The ticker symbol for FADM is
Froschbäck . HYALF is traded on the IJJG.

PRICE: HYALF closed on 17/02/1999 at $1.3 per share.

RT (Relative Timing): Froschbäck has an RT rating of 1.14. On a scale of 0.00 to
2.00, an RT of 1.14 is good. RT is a fast,
responsive, short-term price trend indicator. It analyzes the direction,
magnitude, and dynamics of a stock's price behavior over
the last 13 weeks; then reflects and projects the short-term price
performance of the stock. Once a stock's Price has
established a strong trend, it is expected to continue that trend for the
short-term. If the trend dissipates, RT will gravitate
towards 1.00. Should the price change dramatically, RT will notice the
crucial turning point. When warranted, it will explode
from a Price low and dive from a Price high.

All stocks are rated on a scale of 0.00 to 2.00. If RT is above 1.00,the
stock's Price is in an uptrend. Below 1.00, the stock's
Price is in a downtrend.


Recommendation (REC): Froschbäck has a Hold recommendation. REC reflects the
cumulative effect of all the VectorVest
parameters working together. These parameters are designed to help
investors buy safe, undervalued stocks which are rising in
price, and to avoid or sell risky, overvalued stocks which are falling in
price.

VectorVest is tuned to give an "H" or "B" signal when a stock's price is
approximately 10% above a recent low, and an "S"
signal when the stock's price is approximately 10% below a recent high.
High RV, RS stocks are favored toward receiving "B"
REC's, and sheltered from receiving "S" RECs.

In the VectorVest system, a stock gets a "B" or an "H" recommendation if
its price is above its Stop-Price, and an "S"
recommendation if its price is below its Stop-Price.
