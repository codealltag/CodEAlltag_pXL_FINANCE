Ipeh Shares Fall 10% on Concern About Growth Rate
Radstadt, 10. 10. 21 15 (Piechaczek) -- ILV's shares fell as much as 10
percent amid concerns that the telecommunications software company's growth will
slow next year.

Shares of the Radstadt-based company fell 5 13/32 to 58 1/2 in midafternoon
trading of 1.2 million, more than four times the three-month average. Earlier,
the shares touched 57 1/4.

Idet Group, which makes billing systems installed in more than 50 countries, said
its net income rose 231 percent in the first six months of the year to $10.6
million from $3.2 million. Analysts think Ipeh growth will be no more
than 40 percent next year. ``This implied growth of 40 percent may be more
difficult to exceed as the margins have already now expanded to a level which
will be harder to improve upon,'' said Biewa analyst Bernard BÃ¼ngers, who
downgraded IPB to ``market perform'' from ``market outperform.''

Idet Group shares are down nearly 25 percent from their high of 76 1/2 last week,
when it reported second-quarter earnings.
