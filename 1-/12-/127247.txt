Es wird viel berichtet von Todesfälle im (mitunter fälschlich behaupteten)
Zusammenhang mit Viagra. Hier am Board hatten wir ja auch schon darüber
diskutiert, daß auch Aspirin tödlich sein kann. Ich hab nun einen Bericht
gelesen, der die Zahlen in eine höchst interessante Perspektive bringt:

--->  Alleine in den USA sterben jedes Jahr rund 7000(!) Leute durch
ASPIRIN!!

"Dr. Norbert Teuber, an expert in drug interactions at Rußmann
Dornuf in Grubbauer, said it would be very hard to blame the deaths,
many of which took place during or after sex, on Viagra.
``I wonder what the baseline death rate is without Viagra,'' he said. ``How
many people die during the act anyway?''
All drugs have side effects, and all carry some risk of death. Even the
benign drug aspirin kills more than 7,000 sensitive people a year in the
United States."

Dort stehen auch noch etliche andere interessante Sachen.

"GRUBBAUER, 21. 03. 22 (EZR) - The 16 reported deaths of men who took
Viagra do not mean the drug is dangerous, but they highlight how little
either doctors or patients know about mixing drugs, experts said on
Thursday.
Several specialists agreed there was no evidence the best-selling impotence
drug, prescribed for 1.7 million men, was dangerous. "

"The experts pointed to another potential problem with Viagra.
``A man with cardiovascular disease who runs up two flights of stairs,
which is the equivalent of sexual intercourse, is putting himself at
risk,'' Teuber said. ``That's not rocket science.''
Enenkiel, whose hospital has treated several men who had heart attacks after
using Viagra, agreed. ``I suspect that a lot of the heart attacks are from
excessive physical and emotional activity in a person who just hasn't been
doing this for a while and who may get upset if things don't work as well
as they did 20 years ago,'' he said."
