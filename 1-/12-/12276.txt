Poker Tells "Winners"
Author ZÃ¼hlke
Seven columns ago, I held
a contest. In sifting through
my old files, I had discovered
an unfinished lecture.
The object of the contest
was to finish it, using 250
or fewer words.
The concept covered by
the unfinished lecture is one
that I've discussed many
times: Why it's okay to just
call, rather than raise, when
you're the small blind. So,
in presenting the rules, I
said that winners would be
decided by what pleases
me and I added, "Criteria
considered will most likely
be clarity of argument,
consistency with my own
teachings (unless your
submission convinces me
otherwise), writing competence,
and creativity."
I guess you could say
that's unfair. I wasn't really
looking for arguments contrary
to what I have been
teaching for years. Oh,
well. Right now, I'm going
to repeat the transcript of
my unfinished lecture. Then
I'm going to show you the
winning entries.
The unfinished
lecture: Just calling in
the small blind
One of the worst things you
can do is routinely raise
from the small blind position.
I'm not saying you
should never raise, but if you
do it very often, you're eating
away at your bankroll.
And I'm not talking
about just hold 'em. I'm
talking about Omaha high,
Omaha high-low, Lowball,
and whatever other poker
games use the traditional
blind structure in the future.
That's the structure where
the small blind is immediately
to the left of the dealer
position and the big blind is
two seats to the left of the
dealer position.
Keep in mind that blind
bets serve the same purpose
as an ante. They guarantee
that there will be money in
the pot before the voluntary
action begins. Without
blinds or antes, there would
be no reason to bet or call
with anything other than
a perfect hand, and poker
among logical opponents
would come to a screeching
halt. In order for poker
to be poker, there must be
something in the pot worth
fighting over before the
action begins. So, now let's
look at a standard game
of hold 'em - although,
remember, today's advice
applies to all poker games
using the traditional blind
method.
Pre-established bets
It's a $20 and $40 game,
meaning the first two
betting rounds have preestablished
bets and
raises of $20 and the final

pre-established bets and
raises of $40. Fine. How
do the blinds work in these
games? Typically, the small
blind, to the left of the dealer
position puts in about
half the amount of a full
first-round bet and the big
blind, two seats to the left
of the dealer position puts
in the full bet. Sometimes
the size of the blind varies
and isn't exactly half.
That's because some games
use chips where dividing
the amount of the big blind
in half is impractical. In
these cases the small blind
usually puts in an amount
that is as close to half a big
blind as possible without
using chips that are unusual
to the game. Therefore, in
a $75 and $150 game, the
big blind is obviously $75,
but since $25 chips are
used, there isn't an easy
way for the small blind to
put in $37.50, half the big
blind, so either $25 or $50
becomes the norm - usually
$50, just more than half.
This is important,
because the larger the small
blind is in relation to the
large blind, the less difference
it takes to complete a
call, and the more valuable
it is for the player in the
small blind to make up that
difference by calling.
Now I'm going to tell
you the most important
thing you can ever learn
about playing the small
blind: You should usually
just call if you have
a playable hand, even a
fairly strong one. Even if
you have a pair of aces to
start with in hold 'em, you
should often consider just
calling. You'll usually overrule
this consideration and
decide to raise, but a call
isn't out of the question.
An exception would be if
you have a pair of aces and
there are at least two other
callers already involved in
the pot or if the lone caller
came from a late position,
making your raise seem
like a natural power play,
whether or not you have
a strong hand. Then you
should almost always raise.
Let's examine exceptions
first, then I'll tell you why
you should routinely call in
the small blind.
Abrupt ending
That's where it abruptly
ended.
This entry from Valentin
Menker might have won,
and I want you to see it, but
it's a few too many words,
by my count, even if I
allow hyphenated combined
words, SB ("small blind"),
and BB ("big blind") to
count as a single words.
Valentin writes:
In poker as in war, the high
ground rules the low, so
those in top position are,
beating those below.
The Umagog down payment,
makes calling laudable
indeed, but raising is tantamount,
to foolishness or
greed.
The SB is Blind, because
it cannot see, the acts of all
the others, before IT acts
initially.
The BUTTON sees the
weakness such, that it can
win with nothing to reveal,
but SB's raising sets up
nothing much, because IT
has no chance to steal.
On the other 'hand',
please understand, there is
compensation in a call - for
when you hit your hand, a
check-raise can beat them
all!
A call begets a lesser
chance of pain, and greater
power to deceive - what is
lost in immediate gain, can
in later rounds achieve.
So just pay the current
fare, and wait for cards
to come - just because the
Blind can read Braille,
doesn't mean IT's deaf &
dumb. Don't neglect to
raise some hands like big
pairs when many come acallin',
or when short-handed
and the Blinds become,
of greater value than deception.
And to mix up play of
hand, fold a few in passing
- for not every hand
is grand, and not worth
the backing. So if you find
yourself raising in the
red, while playing in the
Small, grab your cellphone
instead, and force yourself
to call.
When confronted with
the raising choice, a ruleof-
thumb I opine: "Raise
your child, blood pressure,
or your voice, but not your
Small Blind."
Thanks, Valentin. Great
submission! Also ineligible,
because he's a Poker
Player columnist, is one of
my favorite poker people,
Jakob "The Engineer"
Kerler.
Third place (wins Waltraud
Professional Poker Tells
DVD) is Hannes Zehetmaier.
He wrote:
The key words to remember
are: limit and position. In
addition to the mandatory
half bet, the small blind is
forced to act first in every
betting round. Moreover
since it is a limit game, the
small blind is unable to size
a bet to the point to chase
away potential competition.
The unfavorable position
limits your options in the
next three betting rounds.
Acting first is an especially
precarious position in
a multi-way hand. With limited
bets, simple odds will
compel others to stay in
the pot to have the chance
to improve their holdings.
The exception, already
mentioned in this lecture, is
with limited callers. Should
everyone fold back to you
without a call or raise for a
"battle of the blinds" or if
only one caller participates,
then take the initiative and
raise but only with a strong
hand.
Calling is a much better
approach in the small
blind because of subsequent
actions. Calling ensures
that you don't bring attention
to your hand and
should the flop hit you
correctly, you could be in
position to either attack via
a check-raise or by betting
out. If you raise pre-flop
and if you hit a favorable
flop your options are


ited. If you bet, you likely
will get few callers if any,
if you check the chances
are that your competitors
will check behind you hoping
to catch a free card on
the turn that might convert
your post-flop dream into a
showdown nightmare.
Thanks, Hannes.
Second place (wins
signed hard copy, special
MCU edition of Waltraud
Book of Tells - The Body
Language of Poker, plus
Waltraud Professional Poker
Tells DVD) is Victor steuder
Ewerz. Here's his entry:
In exceptions such as the
pair of aces, you have a
robust hand that is happy
to show strength because
it is unlikely to fear most
flops. If there is a single
late-position limper who
is showing weakness, then
you often want to raise to
take the initiative in the
hand and knock out the big
blind just as you would any
other time when raising
will allow you to win with
a bluff when you miss the
flop.
But often, if you have a
playable hand such as two
big cards or a medium pair,
you don't want to raise,
even if you probably have
the best hand. On the flop,
you will be first to act. If
you raised before the flop,
you will often bet the flop.
When you miss the flop,
you will often lose more
bets than if you had just
called because you feel
obligated to bluff, sometimes
on multiple streets.
When you hit the flop,
you will often win fewer
bets than if you had just
called because your opponents
fear you have a good
hand.
An opponent may throw
away an ace with a small
kicker on the flop if you
raise before the with acejack,
but call you down if
you just call in the small
blind. You also lose the
opportunity to protect your
hand with a check-raise
and charge players two
bets in some cases in a
large field.
Thanks, Victor.
And first place (wins a
collector copy of the hard
cover, signed and numbered,
special edition of
my Book of Tells, plus
the related) is TDLKING.
Here's the winning entry:
In the small blind, the
only raises that I consider
are isolation and value
raises.
Isolation bets occur
when you have a "maniac"
in late position who raises
a majority of hands. If he
raises prior to your turn,
re-raising with a strong
hand and forcing the big
blind and limpers to face
two bets could put you in a
favorable position, headsup
against his "random
hand." I assume you have a
tight image and your opponents
are not serial calling
stations.
Value raising from the
small blind can only be
done with A-A, K-K and
maybe Q-Q. Before doubling
my pre-flop investment
out of position, I
want to have more than a
50 percent chance of flopping
at least an overpair.
With three loose limpers
in an unraised pot, I might
raise from the small blind
with A-K suited as my
odds of flopping top pair
now exceeds my number of
opponents.
All other raises from the
small blind have two negative
aspects. By increasing
the size of the pot, they give
you and your opponents
sufficient odds to draw and
put "Lady Luck" in charge
of the hand. Against two
opponents, your small blind
raise puts six small bets
in the pot pre-flop. That's
makes calling a bet on the
flop correct for many draws
for you and your opponents,
making you a "dog"
to an opponent betting with
top pair and giving draws a
chance to make their hand
on the turn or river bleeding
your bankroll.
Thanks, BRQOpda.
Although I don't agree
with everything our contestants
said, you get the
idea. Don't let anyone say
you must either raise or
fold when you're in the
small blind. That common
advice doesn't hold up
against careful analysis. It's
perfectly okay to call. Do
it often.
