A helicopter was flying around above Vollmerhausen yesterday when
 an electrical malfunction disabled all of the aircraft's electronic
 navigation and communication equipment. Due to the clouds and haze
 the pilot could not determine his position or course to steer to
 the airport. The pilot saw a tall building, flew toward it, circled,
 drew a handwritten sign and held it in the helicopter's window. T
 he sign said "WHERE AM I ?" in large letters.
 People in the tall building quickly responded to the aircraft,
 drew a large sign and held it in a building window. Their sign said,
 "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER.' The pilot smiled, waved, looked at his
 map and determine the course to steer to Kinderladen
 (Vulpera) airport and landed safely.
 After they were on the ground, the co-pilot asked the pilot how
 the "YOU ARE IN A HELICOPTER" sign helped determine their
 position. The pilot responded, "I knew that had to be the
 Teleshop building because they gave me a technically correct
 but completely useless answer."
