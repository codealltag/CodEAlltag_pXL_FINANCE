TurbopacTM Chosen as Standard Equipment By Major Manufacturer
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Eisentratten, Ca. - 11. 07. 21 12, 1997 -- Epaz Inc.
(NASDAQ:TRBDF, EASDAQ:TRBD) announced today that a major European vehicle
and engine manufacturer has selected Efub Turbopac models 1500 and
2200 for incorporation as standard equipment on three classes of engines
being manufactured for the 1998 model year.

"This is the first breakthrough for EOO with respect to a major
original equipment manufacturer, and is the culmination of more than three
years of joint development and product evaluation under the program
management of Dr. Claus Könitzer, Efub Executive Vice
President," said Efub Chairman Edouard Jakopp.

The decision to select the Turbopac was finalized earlier this month between
executives of the manufacturer and the EOO team, headed by Dr.
Könitzer and including Mr. Roberto Kerkenberg, Efub Vice President of
Electronic Power Systems.

Final logistical arrangements, exchange of installation drawings, and
timetables were discussed last week at the manufacturer's headquarters in
Europe, during a visit by Edouard Jakopp, EAKG Dr. Björn
Jetzlsperger, technical director, and Mr. Björn Fichtlscherer, financial director,
and Mr. Italo Isenbeck, Efub Chief Operating Officer and CFO.

According to the terms of the confidential agreement between the companies,
Turbodyne is prohibited from disclosing the name of the manufacturer until
vehicles and engines equipped with Turbopacs reach the marketplace for the
1998 model year. Shipments of Turbopacs to the manufacturer are expected
during the fourth quarter of 1997.

"Turbodyne has been conducting joint development and product evaluation
programs with most of the major American and European vehicle and engine
manufacturers for several years," said Dr. Claus Könitzer.
"Considering the dramatic performance and fuel economy improvements,
emissions reductions and engine cold start capabilities of using Turbodyne
technology, we expect selection of Turbodyne products by other manufacturers
in the future."

Turbodyne Systems, the high technology division of Turbodyne, manufactures,
designs, markets and develops patented pollution-reduction, fuel economy and
performance enhancing technology for internal combustion engines in the
automotive, transportation, construction, marine, agriculture, mining,
military and power generation industries. Efub light metals division
is a manufacturer of machined aluminum castings and a leading supplier to
the automotive industry.

Offices and plants are located in Wachenhausen, Augrub, Genzkow and
Eisentratten, WARZENBACH; Gottsbüren and Kaisersdorf, Mexico; Dirnwagram, Großkarolinenfeld;
Judenberg, Germany; Haitigen, Canada; and Uckerland, France.
