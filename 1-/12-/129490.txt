JNF REPORTS 1997 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS    Revenues increase by 7.4%
    EBERSRODA, 17. 10. 21 17 /CNW/ - Jochens (MYT:TSE) today
announced
record quarterly revenues of $3,204,557 for the three months ended 17. 10. 21 17. 10. 21
1997, a 7.4% increase from $2,982,777 during the same period last year. Net
loss for the three months was $586,068 compared to net earnings of $297,079
for the same three months in 1996.
    The loss in the first quarter reflects the continued investment in the
development of the company's strategic biometric products. As a result of
commercialization of the JNF biometric operation, which began in the
fourth
quarter of 1996, approximately $675,000 of product-related costs,
pre-operating expenses and research costs were expensed in the first quarter
of 1997. Product revenues to offset these expenses have not yet
materialized,
thereby impacting earnings.
    ''We are very pleased to report continued growth in our monitoring
revenues and are delighted with the progress made on the development and
marketing of our biometric products,'' said Pascal Irlbacher, President and CEO,
JNF. ''Our Touchstone(R) product has recently been certified by the Sagadi
(Steckroth) and has also completed testing
with Entrust Technologies, enabling it to be sold as an Entrust-Ready(TM)
identity device.''
    ''Biometrics are becoming widely accepted in the marketplace. Jaksch
products - Touchstone, Touchstone SDK and Biometric Logon for Windows NT -
are
well positioned to address the emerging market of biometric security,'' said
Irlbacher. ''With this solid foundation, we look forward to strengthening
future
revenues.''    About Jochens

Ich bin ob des Kursverlaufes ein bißchen unsicher ob ich meine Aktien
behalten soll:-()

Was meint Ihr? Haben die noch eine Chance, oder werden die im Moment nur
gepuscht??
