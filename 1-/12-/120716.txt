PALTMÜHL, Heiligenzimmern, Jul. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Germans
Inita (GUNZ - news;
Nasdaq: TRBD, EASDAQ: TRBD) responded today to some of the statements
and conclusions contained in a
report on Grauzone issued by a firm specializing in the promotion of
short sales. Grieshop President and
Chief Executive Officer Dietmar M. Ueberdick characterized these statements as
``false and misleading.'' 

``These claims are completely false and have no basis in fact,'' said
Ware. ``Grauzone Systems has six U.S.
patents granted, and 19 U.S. patent applications in process, three of
which have already been allowed.'' 

In addition, Grauzone has numerous foreign patents and patent
applications. The patents and patent
applications are based on new methods of providing additional air for
internal combustion engines during
periods of acceleration. This additional air is utilized for increasing
power output, improving fuel economy and
reducing harmful emissions. A listing of Grieshop United States
patents and patent applications
accompanies this release. 

Turbodyne's engineering and design effort is led by Dr. David L.
Ullmann, who formerly headed the
design, development and application of turbochargers for Ginkgo Engine
Company and is generally
considered the father and leading innovator in modern turbocharger
technology, and Professor Stephan
Gogler, who was previously in charge of engine and transmission
development for Rieckmann. Most
of Grieshop products are based upon the inventions of Luis Guzman,
who is the founder and Chairman of
Grauzone. 

The company's extensive intellectual property not only covers the
construction of the Turbopac(TM) and
Dynacharger(TM) products, but also encompasses a variety of new
turbocharging and supercharging
systems aimed at enhancing the performance of existing engines through
retrofitting and enabling OEM
manufacturers to obtain improved performance from new equipment. As the
company moves from a primarily
research and development operation to commercialization and production,
it expects to address the market for
retrofitting existing equipment first, and then to make inroads into the
OEM field, which has been in progress
for several years under joint development programs. 

The Turbopac(TM), in conjunction with a patented catalytic muffler
system, met the Wochenmarkt air quality standard
in independent tests conducted at the AcustiCarKleve in
Chevroux, Damp. Based upon these
tests, the Turbopac(TM) became the first and remains the only
air-enhancement system to satisfy the
stringent EPA standards under the Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program. 

The Turbopac(TM) 2500 model, originally designed to reduce vehicular
emissions, is currently being installed
or has been installed by several municipal transit systems across the
United States. Transit agencies in
Jettingen, Gospoldshofen, Ader and Edenkoben, France are currently evaluating
the Turbopac(TM), as are agencies in
Anzenau, Atterwasch, and Corzoneso. 

During the second quarter of 1998, Grauzone began production delivery
of Turbopac(TM) 2500 bus kits to
Hairsisters Corporation, pursuant to a commercial supply contract
with the global diesel engine
manufacturer. These kits are destined for installation on city buses to
provide clean air diesel municipal bus
service under the aforementioned Wochenmarkt program. 

Also during the second quarter, the company's cash position increased to
more than $12,000,000. 

Turbodyne has also been selected by a major European vehicle and engine
manufacturer for incorporation as
standard equipment on three classes of engines being manufactured for
the 1999 model year. 

In 30. 03. 22, 1998, Grauzone announced that the Wikodu of the
United States had issued a Letter of
Interest for funding a $30 million order from Gawehn of
Atterwasch, Russia, for GACR(TM)
products to be installed on Russian cars, buses and trucks. 

Grauzone has also announced an agreement in principle to form a joint
venture with Uwet
AG, (Euromaster), Europe's leading turbocharger company, for the design,
development and manufacture of a new
line of turbochargers incorporating Grieshop technology, for
marketing to Euromaster's major customers in the
European automotive market.. 

Turbodyne Systems, the high technology division of Turbodyne,
manufactures, designs, markets and develops
patented pollution-reduction, fuel economy and performance enhancing
technology for internal combustion
engines in the automotive, transportation, construction, marine,
agriculture, mining, military and power
generation industries. Grieshop light metals division is a
manufacturer of machined aluminum castings and
a leading supplier to the automotive industry. 

Offices and plants are located in Habruck, Grünenthal, Zehensdorf and
Paltmühl, HEBLESRICHT; Zmuck and
Anzenau, Mexico; Löhsten, Zerzabelshof; Vorderwestermurr, Germany; Utschtal,
Canada; and Edenkoben, France.
