Poker Tells "Always"
from The Doc Mister Dr. U. Crusen

Sometimes you'll
hear a recommendation
that you
should always take
a specific course of action
in poker under certain
conditions. Such advice is
almost always wrong. Note
that I said almost always
wrong--that "almost"
modifies today's word,
"always." "Always" has its
moments, but not many.
Your best tactics in
poker and in everyday
life come from assuming
you're always going
to routinely do something
and then try to find
reasons why you won't.
That's the function of
"almost." If you don't
find compelling reasons
to overrule "always," you
stick to your choice and do
the obvious. If you do find
reasons, you're honoring
the "almost."
Don't be bewildered by
what I just said. The key
is that if you try to make
decisions under time constraints
with no starting
point, your evaluation is
apt to be muddled. You
usually won't be able to
organize your thoughts
quickly enough. So it's
helpful and appropriate
to begin with a bias.
Understand that a bias,
used in this way, isn't a
bad thing. It isn't a realworld
prejudice. Instead,
it's just an initial bestguess
bestguess
to which you have
no emotional attachment
and don't care whether--
after examination--it turns
out to be right or wrong.
Today, I'll continue
this series that allows me
to both ask and answer
my own questions, and
I'll focus on the "almost
always" method.
Question 21: When you
have a choice to bet or
check, which should you
choose as an initial bias?
Under the method I've
just described, it's wrong
to start without a bias!
This runs counter to the
lifestyles of fair-minded
thinkers. In courts of laws,
jurors sometimes are told
not to form an opinion
until hearing all the evidence.
But that's stupid.
By doing that you give
the evidence opportunities
to confuse you, because
you won't know where to
start in your evaluation,
and you might give more
importance to issues that
seem to stick out in your
mind at whim. To be fair,
you can evaluate evidence
this way if you're quite
careful in your methodology
and take the time to
rate and compartmentalize
all the factors. But human
beings who aren't trained
in being objective often
fail as jurors when they
try. So, what I'm saying is
that, as a juror with almost
unlimited time to weigh
evidence, you can start
from a clean slate without
any bias--but it's usually
not the best method. The
so-called "presumption of
innocence" makes sense,
because it establishes an
initial bias. But the advice
to not lean toward a decision
until you hear all the
evidence doesn't always
make sense.
Wrong for a
poker player
And if it's not the best
method for a juror with
all the time in the world
to evaluate, it's definitely
wrong for a poker player
who has scant seconds to
decide. Be initially biased
and be proud of it! When
you begin to employ this
counterintuitive key to
success, you'll be rewarded
almost immediately.
I'll remind you one
more time: In this discussion,
I'm not using the
word "bias" to mean that
you're not objective. This
isn't the kind of bias that
causes you to seek conformation
of your opinion
and reject evidence to the
contrary. Instead, this is
a contrived starting-point
bias that you'll try to
override. As such, this is
closely related to what's
become known as the scientific
method--where you
declare a hypothesis and
then try to destroy it.
Now, as to checking or
betting, which is the better
initial bias? You could routinely
assume you're going
to check and then try to
find solid reasons why betting
is a superior choice.
Or you could routinely
assume you're going to bet
and then seek reasons to
check. Which is better?
Neither. Choose one
that's easiest for you. If
you're objective, both
biases will lead you to the
same correct decision!
Question 22: Is there a
better method for choosing
an initial bet-orcheck
bias?
Yes. You can make more
powerful use of the limited
time you have to make a
bet-or-check decision by
using these biases...
Assume you're initially
going to check if your
opponents are tricky or
if your image isn't commanding
at the moment.
At all other times, assume
you're going to bet. Then
evaluate the situation right
now and try to override
that decision. If you succeed,
do the opposite of
your original bias--check
instead of betting, or
bet instead of checking.
Otherwise, stick with your
bias.
If you use this simple
method, you'll be surprised
how quickly
and how clearly your
poker decisions begin to
improve
