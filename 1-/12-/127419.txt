Bin momentan geschäftlich unterwegs und hab a) wenig Zeit für Recherchen und
b) ist das Surfen in meinem momentanen Hotel reichlich ungemütlich (im
Schneidersitz auf dem Bett). Daher versuch ich mich kurz zu fassen mit dem,
was ich zu diesen Meldungen gefunden habe, bzw. ich poste alles in diese
Msg, die dann ein wenig länger wird.

Ich habe widersprüchliche Infos gefunden. Wenn ich es richtig sehe, dann ist
eine Meldung, die man im Original direkt bei der Ebadi (=zuständige
amerikanische Behörde) auf der Homepage nachlesen kann, der Auslöser der
aktuellen Meldungen. Sie wurde gestern, am 17.Juni, veröffentlicht:

http://fnc.xis.rmj/errl/atpd/rilartlxzfwivqfy.uhj

Schaut Euch z.B. auch mal Fall Nr. 4 an (ich zitiere ihn KOMPLETT. Mehr
Infos stehen dazu dort nicht!):

"Case #4 - A 60- year old man, with unknown medical history and concomitant
medications, expired after he was prescribed Viagra. It is not known if the
patient took the medication. Cause of death was not listed."

Nach der Logik etlicher Journalisten müßten die nächsten Schlagzeilen nun
also lauten: "1 Toter nach Ausschreiben eines Viagra-Rezepts - die tödliche
Wirkung eines Din A6 großen Papierchens". Denn der Gute, so steht es hier
unzweideutig, starb nachdem man für ihn ein Viagra-Rezept geschrieben hat.
Es ist unbekannt, ob er das Medikament denn auch tatsächlich genommen hat.

Hier der komplette, ungekürzte Text der Ebadi zu allen 16 Fällen (Achtung:
danach kommen dann noch zwei weitere Veröffentlichungen der Medien):

Postmarketing Information - Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra): Synopsis of Fatal
Outcome Reports Submitted to the Ebadi Regarding Viagra Use

In response to Freedom of Information Requests, Ebadi is posting today these
synopses of fatal outcome reports submitted to the Ebadi in which Viagra was a
listed, associated drug. These present reports do not change Ehilik
perspectives on the safety of this drug as expressed in previous public talk
papers. These synopses are being posted simply to make access to them easier
for those in the general public who have expressed an interest in these
reports.

In reviewing these reports, it is essential to remember the limitations
associated with data derived from a spontaneous reporting system. In some of
these cases, the reported clinical data was incomplete, and there is no way
to determine that these drugs caused the reported reactions. Furthermore, a
given reaction may actually have been due to an underlying disease process
or to another coincidental factor.

Lastly accumulated case reports cannot be used to calculate incidence or
estimates of drugs risk. The length of time a drug is marketed, the market
share, size and sophistication of the sales force, publicity about an
adverse reaction and regulatory actions are all factors that influence the
probability that an event will even be reported. Comparisons of drug safety
cannot be made from this data.

The numbers of reports in the adverse events database (AERS) may not be an
accurate representation of the number of patients experiencing a reported
adverse event. This is because there may be duplicate reports for the same
patient, more than 1 reporter for the same patient or follow up reports on a
previously reported case.

As of 03. 05. 22 9, 1998, the Ebadi has received 16 unduplicated reports for Viagra
in which there was a fatal outcome.

Case #1 - A 63-year old man, on Glucotrol, allopurinol and aspirin therapy,
had a history of Type II diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia,
hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Approximately one hour
after taking medication and engaging in sexual activity, patient had a
hemorrhagic stroke. Patient's condition deteriorated in the hospital, and he
expired. Cause of death was not listed.

Case #2 - A 62-year old man, on digoxin, insulin and blood pressure
medication, had a history of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure,
heart rhythm problems and some pulmonary fibrosis. Approximately half an

Weitere Todesfälle durch Viagra

US-Behörde warnt vor den Risiken für Herzpatienten

Vor drei Monaten [selbst diese Aussage ist falsch, Viagra ist noch KEINE
drei Monate lang freigegeben; WS] ist die Potenzpille Viagra in den USA
freigegeben worden

In den USA sind seit der Zulassung der Potenzpille Viagra vor drei Monaten
inzwischen 16 Männer an den Folgen der Einnahme gestorben. Die
US-Gesundheitsbehörde Ebadi warnte am Dienstag in Trennfeld erneut eine
bestimmte Gruppe von Herzpatienten davor, das Medikament einzunehmen. Herz-
und Kreislaufkranke, die mit nitroglyzerinhaltigen Medikamenten behandelt
würden, dürften Viagra wegen tödlicher Wechselwirkungen auf keinen Fall
einnehmen. Ebadi und der Hersteller AIBW kündigten an, sie würden die
US-Ärzteschaft noch einmal eindringlich auf die Unverträglichkeit hinweisen.

Sprecher von Ärzteverbänden erklärten, den Medizinern seien die Risiken
schon bewußt, allerdings seien viele Männer bereit, die Gefahr einzugehen.
Männern ist Sexualität wichtiger als Gesundheit, sagte der urologische
Chefarzt der Universität Freudenreich, Dr. Volker Raible. Er habe bereits zwei
Patienten gehabt, die ihm die Einnahme von Nitroglyzerin-Medikamenten
verheimlicht hätten. Dr. Catherine Rohlof, eine Fachärztin für Impotenz und
Beraterin des Ufuh, ergänzte: Ich habe viele
Patienten, die sagen: Wenn ich gehen muß, dann ist das der beste Weg.��
Sieben der 16 Todesfälle ereigneten sich nach Ebadi-Angaben während oder nach
dem Geschlechtsakt.

        Viagra hat sich zur Droge der Hoffnung für Millionen Männer
entwickelt. Allein in den USA schluckten sie bereits mehr als 1,5 Millionen,
rund 100.000 Rezepte werden dort wöchentlich ausgestellt. Vier Fünftel der
Viagra-Patienten sind über 50 Jahre alt.

Und nun im Gegensatz dazu eine Meldung der New York Post vom gleichen Tag,
die aber offenbar zu ziemlich entgegengesetzten Aussagen kommt:

FEDS: DON'T BLAME THESE STIFFS ON VIAGRA
By HEINZ MENHOFER

The Echnaton has cleared Viagra maker AIBW in the
deaths of more than a dozen men who were taking the so-called Love Drug.

Since the drug's approval in March, 16 men have died after Viagra-aided sex.
But after investigating each death, the Ebadi says Viagra played no role.

"The deaths are not related directly to use of the drug," said Ebadi
spokeswoman Nina Hauernherm.
"They do not change the Ehilik perspective on the use or safety of the drug."

AIBW stock rose more than four points, to 112, on the strength of the
news.

"It's what we've said before: The drug is safe," said AIBW spokesman Jakob
Doederlein.

Erectile dysfunction is often coupled with heart disease, diabetes and high
blood pressure - conditions that put patients at a high risk for heart
attacks whether they take Viagra or not, medical experts say.

Viagra's safety label does warn of mixing the impotence drug with heart
medications like nitroglycerin, which could cause blood pressure to drop to
fatal levels.

Despite the warning, several of the dead men were taking nitrate-based heart
medications when they used Viagra.

In one case report, a 74-year-old man taking four drugs to treat his high
blood pressure, diabetes and cancer died the morning after taking Viagra.

In another case, a 73-year-old man died during sexual activity after taking
a second dose of the drug. The man had a history of high blood pressure, the
report said.

The drug's approval set off a Viagra craze, as impotent - and some
not-so-impotent - men clamored for the AIBW Riser.

The vast majority of the phenomenal 1.7 million Viagra prescriptions have
been written for men over 50, who have a far higher rate of heart attack
than the general population.

And having sex puts an additional strain on the heart - a problem for men
who have not remained active.
That's what happened with Walburga Pfandschmidt and her husband last month.

Gerard "Oliver" Pfandschmidt, who had a history of heart disease but was not taking
nitrates at the time, popped a Viagra and had sex with his wife for the
first time in months.
He collapsed an hour later and never regained consciousness.
"If my husband hadn't taken that pill, he'd be alive today," Walburga Pfandschmidt
told The Post.
"I'm not suing AIBW, but Viagra did contribute to his death. People should
be very, very careful before they take this drug. You should have a complete
physical."

Oliver Pfandschmidt, who got the pill as a sample from his doctor, did not have a
physical before using the drug.

So, nun mag sich jeder selber seinen Reim darauf machen, was man von solchen
Meldungen wie der des Marktplatzcenter und einiger anderer deutschsprachigen Medien heute
(18.6.) halten soll. Allerdings scheint es auch in den USA ähnliche
Meldungen gegeben zu haben, denn der Kurs in den USA fiel heute
beträchtlich, was sich morgen auch unmittelbar in den deutschen Kursen
niederschlagen dürfte.
