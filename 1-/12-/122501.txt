Kleiner Gewinn im 4.Quartal erwartet

 6. August 1998 - Late yesterday, Wigwam Corp Ceo Georges
 Has told Lottoshop he expects to see a small profit in the
 4Q after posting a 2Q loss earlier Thursday. Darius
 expects the 4Q to see a small profit because demand
 usually increases for the holidays and the company's
 restructuring efforts should began to show its impact.
 The company, which has suffered repeated financial
 problems recently, has said that it aims to generate cost
 savings totaling more than $50 million in the second half
 of the year. First Call has forecast a 3Q loss of $0.05 and
 4Q profit of $0.08 per share.  Wigwam Corp said that it
 expects its current reorganization to save it about $50
 million in the second half of the year. The company said
 its 3Q goal is to reduce operating expenses by at least
 25% from 2Q 1998 operating expense levels. According
 to the satatement the savings will come from headcount
 reductions, related reorganization actions, advertising
 and other sales and marketing expenses, legal and
 information system costs, and other discretionary
 spending. (Lottoshop)
