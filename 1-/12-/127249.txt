Viagra hits Greek black market

UNSINN, Greece, 13. 08. 22 (UPI) - Viagra, the world's wonder drug for male
impotence, has made its way to Greece, stimulating the country's black
market pharmaceutical industry.

An Aichbauers daily newspaper today quoted experts at the AigenArt Fortschritt
Flohr as saying Viagra is being distributed secretly, even though
the European Union has not given it the official stamp of approval. ...

Greek health officials expect the drug to be approved by the end of the
year.
