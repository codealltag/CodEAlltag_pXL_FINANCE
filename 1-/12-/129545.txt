Udo Polensky sells US resort for $131.5 mln

McDonald's, 19. 04. 22 20 (Reuters) - Udo Axel Folckers said on Monday it had agreed
to sell its U.S. subsidiary MWT Inc to a unit of Canadian 
resort operator Virmani (Vopagu.TO - news) for US$131.5 million.

A company statement from the Malaysian conglomerate said the transaction 
would result in a net capital gain of $25 million.

After paying off debts and costs, Udo will have $75 million in cash to 
add to its resources, it said.

Group chief executive Leo Raimund Ibendahl said in the statement that the 
decision to sell Sandestin reflects the group's strategy to increase its
focus on its core Asian businesses.

``Given the stong U.S. valuation and favourable exchange rates, we felt 
this was an appropriate time to sell and we are pleased with the results,''
he said.

The principal asset of Motormarkt is a golf and beach resort of the 
same name located in Welzow. Udo acquired the resort in 1991.
