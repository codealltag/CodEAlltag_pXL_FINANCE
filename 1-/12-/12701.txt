Poker Tells Enhanced
Author Solscheid

You understand how position
works in poker, right?
The earlier that you must
act, the more players are
waiting to pounce, and the
stronger your hand needs
to be to earn profit. Fine.
What if you didn't need
to settle for the rotation
of the blinds or dealer
position to determine
when you got to act late?
Remember, in the long
run, when you act late,
you make more money.
You can add a period to
that - there are no exceptions.
Players who get to
see what others do before
making their decisions
have an advantage. Period.
(There, I added it for you.)
Today, I'm going to
share the transcript of an
old lecture that helps you
act in later positions more
often. Listen...
The miracle of
enhanced position
I don't need to remind you
how important position is
in poker. The earlier you
must act, the more cautious
you have to be about making
the first wager, because
there are lots of opponents
waiting to pounce on you.
But when you're in a late
position, you get to wait to
see what your opponents
do first, before committing
to the pot. That's why
you can almost always be

with less powerful hands
after many opponents have
already folded. There simply
aren't as many opponents
waiting, and it's less
likely that one of them has
a hand strong enough to
beat you.
But when you open
pots in early position, you
usually need significant
strength, because there
are many players who
might have you beat. For
instance, in a 10-handed
hold 'em game, if three
players fold and I have six
players to act after me, I
probably can't justify calling
or raising the blind
with K-10 of mixed suits.
There's too much competition
left, and I can prove
that this is not a profitable
play in the long run.
But with only four players
left to act, that same
K-10 of mixed suits often
IS profitable, if played correctly
throughout the rest
of the betting rounds. Now,
let me ask you a question.
Wouldn't you like to
exchange that K-10 that
you'll need to fold with
six players yet to act for
a profitable situation with
only four players yet to
act?
Well, you can! And
when you master that bit
of magic, you can play
hands that are unprofitable

on the surface and make a
lot of money from them in
the long run.
Players waiting
How do you do this? It's
really not hard.
I always look at the
players who are waiting to
act after me. This is important.
Now, remember what
I've taught you about tells.
Players who seem to be
paying the most attention
are likely to fold. Also,
players who are reaching
toward their chips are likely
to fold - unless they're
rank beginners who are
playing poker as if it were
bingo.
The players I'm concerned
about are those
who don't seem to care.
They're frequently looking
away from the action, trying
to lure you into the pot
by seeming uninterested
and making it appear safe
for you to wager. This is
consistent with the standard,
act strong when weak
and weak when strong
characteristic that defines
most of your opponents.
The trick is to spot the
players waiting to act
behind you who do NOT
seem uninterested. Those
are the ones you can usually
eliminate as being
potential players in the
pot. They seem interested,
and it's an act, so it's as if
they'd already folded, even
though they are still waiting
to act. So, because you
can think of them as having
already folded, your
position is actually better
than it seems.
Profitable
This means, if you can
eliminate two players as
potential competitors for
the pot, your K-10 isn't
really in the third seat with
six players waiting to act,
it's effectively in the fifth
seat with only four players
waiting to act - and that
makes it profitable. And
that's just one example of
hundreds of similar hands
that can be increased in
profit by sliding your position
position
forward, in different
types of poker.
Just by being observant
and watching how opponents
are going out of their
way to look interested out
of turn, you can increase
your position. Slide it forward.
Think about how
important that is. Good
position is critical at poker.
The best positions make
money and the worst positions
lose money. Your
goal in the best positions is
to earn even more money
and your goal in the worst
positions is to lose less.
When I say lose less, I'm
considering that you're
paying something to get
your hand, either through
a proportioned share of the
blinds or through antes,
so if you fold every time
in bad positions, you lose
that theoretical money. If
you play perfectly, you can
win some back, thus losing
less.
Anyway, position really
matters. If you could be
in the best positions all
the time, you'd get super
rich in a hurry. I can't
promise you that. But I
can promise you that you
can average better position
just by paying attention
to who's going to
fold after you.
There are a couple of
other benefits. You will
seem to be playing hands
that are too weak for your
position, and that's good
advertising. And you often
will have hands other than
the ones your opponents
expect, so you can gain
extra money through this
built-in deception.
Much better
Sometimes I'll be in an
early position and I'll see
that everyone is probably
going to fold, right
up to the big blind. Now
if I raise with a 10-8 of
mixed suits, not only am
I going to enhance my
image and get more calls
in the future, I'm actually
not in a bad situation versus
the big blind. I have
a semi-competitive hand.
I couldn't normally play
it except to attack the big
blind from the small blind
position - but now I AM
effectively in the small
blind position - except
much better.
Why better? Because
the big blind will respect
my raise more from that
position, and I'm more
likely to walk off with
both blinds without a fight.
And, because I'm not
actually in the small blind
position, I'll get to act
after the big blind on all
future rounds of betting.
When you think about
that, you begin to realize
how profitable sliding up
in position by being observant
really is. Just watch
the players waiting to act
after you and that money
can be yours
