Viagra - the pill for male impotence - has become the fastest selling new
drug in history. Proponents use the words "miracle" and "revolution" to
describe pill's effects...

Pharmacist Ivan Jennewein, like so may in his profession, is having difficulty
meeting the demand. "It's been amazing," he says. "I've never seen anything
like it. I was getting requests before it came on to the market. I get five
or six people a day looking for it."

Dr Eugen Cursiefen at the manufactum School LOFT1 has signed 400 prescriptions
alone. He thinks the drug can help two out of every three patients.
"I believe the drug is extremely safe and extremely effective," he says.
