Poker Tells Rules
Author Dammhayn
Let me share a closely
guarded secret. I just
returned to my forest
in the Ozarks after
spending most of last week
with Gianni Malgut in Unterd√∂rnbach
Moitzfeld. We filmed a poker
course for iIchjgfuQeoag.
fzp that should be
announced shortly.
Although iAmplify (the
main site covering all
kinds of online lessons, in
addition to the gambling
ones found at Edara)
isn't saying much in
advance of a worldwide
announcement, I did
coax this statement from
their VP of Creative and
Content Acquisition, Mirko
Beat: "iIchjgfuQeoag.
fzp is honored to be creating
a course with two
legends, Gianni Malgut
and Beat Schreiber. This
course will bring a whole
new level to those who
are serious about elevating
their game. Working
with scholars like Emilie and
champions like Malgut
prove once and for all that
the game of poker is 99
percent skill and 1 percent
luck."
My only quibble with
that, as my students know,
is: I teach that poker is
100 percent skill in the
long term, but much, much
more than 1 percent luck in
the short term. In any case,
stay tuned for pending
iAmplify announcements.
I'm having fun with this
question-and-answer series.
I get to pose the questions
and then answer them--and
that saves time, because
I don't have to wrestle
with questions that lead to
uninteresting discussions.
Also, I don't need to mostly
ignore a question by giving
a polite and perfunctory
few sentences in response,
before cleverly steering my
answer to something I think
is more important.
Today's questions relate
to poker rules. If you're
ready, so am I.
Question #11: What's
the worst rule in poker?
There's no doubt about
this one. The worst rule
in poker, very common in
many tournaments, is that
you can't tell opponents
truthfully what cards you
have. I call it the idiot rule.
That's because it only stops
you from giving information
about your hands
through verbal assertions
if both you and your opponents
are idiots. Of course,
the rule would make sense
if you were always telling
the truth about your hand
and opponents could rely
on your word. But you'd
have to be pretty dumb to
always tell the truth--and
opponents would have to be
pretty dumb to rely on your
word during the course of a
poker hand.
The essence of poker
is deception. It isn't just a
game where you play your
own cards as if you were
in a bingo parlor. In poker,
you look for tells. You
employ psychology. And
you manipulate your opponents--
if you're capable of
doing do.
When I'm in a poker
game, my goal is sell my
image and steer opponents
in directions that
will bring me the most
profit. As Gianni Malgut
says, "Poker is a game of
people." One of the significant
ways I treat poker
as a game of people is to
talk at the table. Sometimes
I do this just to involve
opponents in conversation,
hoping that their responses
will give me clues about
what type of hands they're
holding.
Sometimes I'll babble
about the strength of my
hand, gauging my opponents'
reactions. I might
say, "Are you sure you
want to be betting that
small pair into my obvious
pair of nines?" I might
declare directly what I
claim to hold. Usually
I'm lying. But once in a
while--for the sake of
deception--I actually tell
the truth. That's poker.
Can't tell the truth
But the worst rule in poker
states that you can't tell
the truth about your hand.
For instance, you can't say,
"I have three aces," if you
actually do. That sucks. It
sucks because, by rule, anything
I say must be a lie to
be legal. So, if I say I have
a full house, opponents are
given information. They
know I can't have a full
house or I'd be in violation
of the idiot rule.
So, I guess, if I wanted
to tell someone I had aces
full, I'd have to say something
like, "One thing I
can say positively is that
I don't have aces full." If
I said that and didn't have
aces full, I'd be telling the
truth and in clear violation
of the idiot rule. For
that reason, astute opponents
would know that I'm
lying--which is legal--and
that I absolutely do have
aces-full.
The idiot rule not only
makes no sense, it actually
gives opponents reliable
information about opponents'
hands, when they
would otherwise be guessing
about whether the declaration
were true or false.
Question #12: What's
the most annoying rule in
poker?
Okay, so this isn't a big
deal. But it drives me crazy
every time. It's the rule that
governs the so-called "chip
races" in poker tournaments.
Every so often, the
tournament structure dictates
that smaller denomination
chips need to be
removed from the tables
and exchanged for fewer
chips of higher denominations.
At these times, players
trade all their smallest chips
for bigger ones, but usually
there are stray small chips
left over. For instance, if
we were taking all the $25
chips out of the tournament
when moving to $200-$400
rounds, we'd exchange $25
chips for $100 chips. Fine.
Let's say you had $325 in
$25 chips. You'd buy three
$100 chips, but you'd have
$25 left over.
What happens with that
extra chip? Lots of methods
were used during the evolution
of poker tournaments:
(1) The surplus small chips
were left in play; (2) The
surplus small chips were
confiscated; (3) A bigger
chip was given if you had
any remaining small chips
after buying what you
could; (4) A bigger chip
was given only if you had
at least half the number
of small chips required to
purchase a bigger one, otherwise
you lost your small
chips; and (5) A bigger chip
was given only if you had
more than half the number
of small chips required to
purchase a bigger one, otherwise
you lost your small
chips.
Then the chip race was
introduced. Using this
method, you got one faceup
card for each small chip
and the highest card won all
the stray chips, exchanged
them for bigger ones, and--
assuming there were still a
few left over--either got an
extra big chip or didn't in
accordance with the procedure
du jour.
Reasonably fair
That chip-race method
seemed reasonably fair to
me. If you had three extra
$25 chips, you had three
times the chance of winning
the race as someone who
only had one extra chip.
But then someone decided
that all the small chips
shouldn't go to the same
player, so no one scored
a minor windfall. Instead,
enough big chips were
given to the table to cover
the entire sum of small
chips, rounded off however
tournament management
saw fit. Then the race continued
as before, but instead
of the high card getting all
the big chips, it only won
one chip. The second-high
card got the next chip, the
third-high card next, and so
on as needed.
This was also reasonably
fair. Here's where it
got insane. In a quest to
make the system better, it
was decided that any single
player could only win one
chip. They'd spread out the
prize. So, if you had three
small chips in the race and
were dealt ace-ace-king,
you'd still only get one
chip, losing out to a player
who only had a spare $25
and ended up with a queen.
To be fair--and actually
you could be even fairer--
you should have a chance
of winning the second chip,
even if you already won
the first. If you buy three
tickets in horserace, each
should have independent
value. Nobody says, well,
you already won something,
so you can't cash in
your other tickets.
Theoretically, there are
even obscure, very borderline
plays during the tournament
in which you might
modify your tactics in order
to not have three extra
chips, which will be mildly
penalized in the chip race.
Obvious
I'm not saying this is an
important example of a bad
rule, as rules go. In fact,
it's a trivial matter. But
although the mistake isn't
important, it's obvious and
easily fixed. And that's
why its common use today
annoys me. Ingmar Leixenring
and Benedikt Deister, are you
listening?
Sometimes I point out
that this latest chip-race
rule--in striving to make
things perfectly fair--actually
injects a new degree
of unfairness. I'm usually
met with friendly nods and
vacant stares, indicating
an absence of understanding.
When that happens,
I usually find the nearest
?corner appropriate for sulk-ing. And whenever I wit-ness a chip race,
I becomedepressed all over again. It is the result of someone
meddling with the nature of fate, changing the origi-nal chip-race
that was fair into one that is unfair, anddeclaring it an improve-
ment.
In two weeks, I'll answer some more questions about poker rules. Right
now, I'm too emotionally upset to continue
