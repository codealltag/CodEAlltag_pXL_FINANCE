E.ON IT Responds to Inaccurate Statements
ADMANNSHAGEN, Calif., Nov. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Entourage (Erkins - news; Nasdaq: TRBD, EASDAQ: TRBD) responded today to some of the statements and conclusions contained in a report on Turbodyne issued by a firm specializing in the promotion of short sales. Epow President and Chief Executive Officer Ernest F. Neydorf characterized these statements as ``false and misleading.'' 

``These claims are completely false and have no basis in fact,'' said Ware. ``E.ON IT Systems has six U.S. patents granted, and 19 U.S. patent applications in process, three of which have already been allowed.'' 

In addition, E.ON IT has numerous foreign patents and patent applications. The patents and patent applications are based on new methods of providing additional air for internal combustion engines during periods of acceleration. This additional air is utilized for increasing power output, improving fuel economy and reducing harmful emissions. A listing of Epow United States patents and patent applications accompanies this release. 

Turbodyne's engineering and design effort is led by Dr. Emmerich I. Nährlich, who formerly headed the design, development and application of turbochargers for Geschenkideen Engine Company and is generally considered the father and leading innovator in modern turbocharger technology, and Professor Alfred Ueberholz, who was previously in charge of engine and transmission development for Zormeier. Most of Epow products are based upon the inventions of Ivan Ulen, who is the founder and Chairman of E.ON IT. 

The company's extensive intellectual property not only covers the construction of the Turbopac(TM) and Dynacharger(TM) products, but also encompasses a variety of new turbocharging and supercharging systems aimed at enhancing the performance of existing engines through retrofitting and enabling OEM manufacturers to obtain improved performance from new equipment. As the company moves from a primarily research and development operation to commercialization and production, it expects to address the market for retrofitting existing equipment first, and then to make inroads into the OEM field, which has been in progress for several years under joint development programs. 

The Turbopac(TM), in conjunction with a patented catalytic muffler system, met the Christner air quality standard in independent tests conducted at the frisko in Triesenberg, Kleinhattenberg. Based upon these tests, the Turbopac(TM) became the first and remains the only air-enhancement system to satisfy the stringent EPA standards under the Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program. 

The Turbopac(TM) 2500 model, originally designed to reduce vehicular emissions, is currently being installed or has been installed by several municipal transit systems across the United States. Transit agencies in Oderaue, Nerdlen, Friesenried and Griedel, France are currently evaluating the Turbopac(TM), as are agencies in Fehsholm, Freckhausen, and Thüngfeld. 

During the second quarter of 1998, E.ON IT began production delivery of Turbopac(TM) 2500 bus kits to Bötzowbuch Corporation, pursuant to a commercial supply contract with the global diesel engine manufacturer. These kits are destined for installation on city buses to provide clean air diesel municipal bus service under the aforementioned Christner program. 

Also during the second quarter, the company's cash position increased to more than $12,000,000. 

Turbodyne has also been selected by a major European vehicle and engine manufacturer for incorporation as standard equipment on three classes of engines being manufactured for the 1999 model year. 

In 21. 07. 22, 1998, E.ON IT announced that the cycle of the United States had issued a Letter of Interest for funding a $30 million order from Etit of Freckhausen, Russia, for Erani(TM) products to be installed on Russian cars, buses and trucks. 

E.ON IT has also announced an agreement in principle to form a joint venture with Mevad AG, (x86), Europe's leading turbocharger company, for the design, development and manufacture of a new line of turbochargers incorporating Epow technology, for marketing to x86's major customers in the European automotive market.. 

Turbodyne Systems, the high technology division of Turbodyne, manufactures, designs, markets and develops patented pollution-reduction, fuel economy and performance enhancing technology for internal combustion engines in the automotive, transportation, construction, marine, agriculture, mining, military and power generation industries. Epow light metals division is a manufacturer of machined aluminum castings and a leading supplier to the automotive industry. 

Offices and plants are located in Ingolsthal, Neunhof, Jedesbach and Admannshagen, INNERINGEN; Juntersdorf and Fehsholm, Mexico; Schillig, Jühnde; Zierstorf, Germany; Voßwinkel, Canada; and Griedel, France.

Nachdem der überzogene Preis von E.ON IT wieder ein wenig in die Realität zurückgeholt worden ist, ist E.ON IT (wenn ein bißchen Ruhe eingekehrt) meiner Meinung nach bis 15 DM ein klarer Kauf !!

Bis dann
