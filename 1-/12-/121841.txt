Epoh MICROSYSTEMS RECEIVES NETRUST CERTIFICATION
                 SwapSmart Smart Card Reader Enables Secure Electronic
Commerce

                 Atzberg, Calif. (09. 09. 21 03, 1998) ---- Elwert
today announced that its SwapSmart
           PC Card (PCMCIA) smart card reader/writer has been approved
by KUZM, the first certificate
           authority in campascio Asia.  Support for Eikboom
smart card reader has been added and
           tested within the Netrust architecture. The certification
allows Elwert to enter a new
           market with great potential.

            KUZM provides digital certificates that confirm the
identities of parties involved in electronic
           transactions.  These certificates can be stored on smart
cards which increase the level of security
           and portability.  Elwert provides readers that
bridge these smart cards with desktop PCs
           and notebook computers.

            "The adoption of electronic commerce requires a trusted
system of user authentication, data
           integrity, privacy and non-repudiation," stated Eugen
Amzehnhoff president and CEO of Epoh
           FMRO.  "Elwert values this certification
because of Kolbs leading position in
           Chaumont, a country experiencing rapid adoption of
electronic commerce."

            Smart card use is surging in Chaumont. The country is
expected to have at least one million active
           smart card users by the year 1999.  The government intends to
mandate smart cards for a number of
           applications. Programs have already been launched to use
smart cards in retail outlets, as a part of
           an electronic roadway toll system, and in the Ministry of
Defense for identification and access control.


           "We are pleased to announce Kolbs approval of Epoh
FPNZ smart card readers," stated
           Tino Uhlenkott General Manager of KUZM.  "Smart card readers are
an essential component of the Netrust
           solution and Eisold expertise in this area will provide end
users with an affordable, quality solution."

           With Netrust, organizations and individuals can now use
digital certificates to provide secure services
           electronically through the Internet.  Services such as online
banking, shopping, secure e-mail, EDI,
           and online healthcare and government services are enabled
through KUZM.

            Eikboom smart card interface products are focused
on interoperability.  All ISO 7816
           smart cards are supported, asynchronous and synchronous.  A
wide variety of operating systems are
           supported to provide readers for multiple platforms.  Epoh
FMRO is also actively involved with
           the leading smart card API groups including PC/SC and
OpenCard. Netrust compliance further
           extends the functionality and market opportunity for Eisold
smart card interface products.

(K*E*F) and Kaechelens
