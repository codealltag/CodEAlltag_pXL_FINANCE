Poker Tells "Half"
Author Pruckner
Before we jump into
today's pool of plentiful
poker profit, here's
an announcement. In
either my next column or
the one after, I'll declare
the winners of December's
"Finish My Lecture
Contest." I expect to finish
grading all the entries by
next week.
If you're not sure what
I'm talking about, that's
because you didn't enter the
contest or read the column
four issues ago. Briefly,
when sifting through my old
documents, I came across
a strange lecture transcript
that seemed incomplete. It
was about the benefits of just
calling, rather than raising, in
the small blind. I suggested
that there were times when
raising was, indeed, the best
solution, but that just calling
was underrated. After
posting the transcript, which
covered several major points,
I invited readers to complete
the lecture for prizes.
Why raise?
The contest is now closed
to entries. But, just so you'll
have something to ponder
while I'm judging the winners,
here are four important
considerations that weigh
on the side of raising when
you're in the small blind.
1. You help establish a
domineering image that can
often work in your favor.
(Applies to both limit and
no-limit hold 'em.)
2. It's significantly more
likely that you can win the
pot when the flop disappoints
you. When you've put the
last raise on the initial betting
round and then bet into your
opponents when first to act
after seeing the flop, they're
more inclined to fold than
they would be had you just
called. (Applies to both limit
and no-limit hold 'em.)
3. You can sometimes
limit the field by chasing
away early position callers
when someone else has
raised. The reraise makes it
much less likely that they'll
stick around to beat you.
Of course, if they're actually
taking the worst of it,
you usually want them to
stick around. But you want
them to fold when they'd
have an expectation of
long-range profit by calling.
You can sometimes elicit
this type of fold by raising.
(While this is obviously
true in no-limit hold 'em, it
particularly applies to limit
games. There, the difference
between calling just
one fixed-size amount from
a single raise two fixed-size
amounts from a reraise can
seem compelling. In limit
games, a raise is not likely
to chase players out who are
already committed to the pot,
but a double raise is.)

4. When no other players
have entered the pot and
it's just the small blind vs.
the big blind, a raise has
excellent chances of chasing
away the only remaining
player and securing a small
immediate profit. (Applies to
both limit and no-limit hold
'em.)
Why call?
And here are three important
considerations that weigh on
the side of just calling when
you're in the small blind.
1. If you just call with a
strong hand, you add an element
of deception that can
assist you in maximizing
profit on the later rounds
of betting. (Applies to both
limit and no-limit hold 'em.)
2. You're getting better
pot odds when you just call.
One common definition of
"Pot odds" is the amount of
chips in the pot right now
weighed against the size
of your bet. We'll use that
definition for this example,
although "pot odds" can also
be based on an estimate of
how big the pot will eventually
be and how much it will
probably cost you to pursue
it.
Using the first, simpler
definition, let's say you're
playing a $10 fixed-limit
hold 'em game, with blinds
of $5 (your small blind) and
$10. When the action returns
to you, there's $45 out there,
consisting of the $10 big
blind, three $10 calls, and
your $5 small blind. If you
just call $5 and the big blind
doesn't exercise his "live
blind" right to raise, you're
getting $45 to $5 or 9 to 1
on your money. If you raise,
making it $20 and everyone
calls (which often won't be
the case), you'll have added
$15 to a pot that will have
grown to $100. You will
have invested $15 against
$85, and the pot odds will be
only 5.67 to 1. The reduced
pot odds mean that there
are many hands you cannot
justify playing for a raise,
because the odds against
them succeeding exceed the
proportional size of the pot.
This is a hard mathematical
reality that disproves
the notion that you should
"always" raise if you're
going to play. (This example
applies mostly to limit, but
is important in no-limit as
well.)
3. The flop will usually
disappoint you. Perhaps
that's the saddest fact in hold
'em. No matter what hands
you start with, you'll wish
you had a different flop most
of the time. Because of this,
the flop is so speculative that
it's often more profitable to
see it cheaply. (Applies to
both limit and no-limit hold
'em.)
Today's word
Now let's examine today's
word: "Half." It used to
be that I was apprehensive
whenever I wrote about
hold 'em. Too many readers
didn't fully understand
how it was played, and I
felt compelled to explain
the procedures each time.
Nowadays hold 'em has
become so popular I worry
that readers may lose interest
if I talk about any other type
of poker.
Nonetheless, I'll risk it,
because this next point is
short and important. It's
about any form of high-low
split poker. This is the text
of a quick lecture I gave
many years ago. In fact, it's
one of the earliest in my
series of vintage lectures
that I've been sharing with
you over the past two years.
Here goes...
The truth about
high-low
Here's the most important
thing I teach about the nature
of high-low split poker. You
need to usually play hands
that have a chance to win
both high and low.
Many players make the
mistake of thinking that half
a pot is worth half as much
as whole pot. It isn't. You
need to win more than two
split pots to equal the profit
of one whole pot. Listen. I'll
make it clear.
Imagine that you're at the
showdown. The pot is $200
and $50 is what you invested
to get there. If you win
the whole pot, you'll earn
$150 profit, right? That's the
$200 in the pot minus the
$50 that was yours to begin
with. But what happens if
you only win half the pot?
Then you collect half of
$200 or $100. But you still
invested $50, so your profit
is only $50 - one hundred
minus fifty.
You can see that, in this
case, winning that whole
pot was worth three times as
much in profit as winning
half the pot. Remember, in
high-low split, winning half
a pot twice is never worth
as much as winning a whole
pot once. That's why you
have to play mostly hands
that have a chance of winning
it all.
