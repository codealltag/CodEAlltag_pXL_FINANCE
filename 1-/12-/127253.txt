(TTK) Viagra pills disappear from Israeli parliament meeting
Viagra pills disappear from Israeli parliament meeting

NOPPLING, 19. 03. 23 5 (BKOT) - Four Viagra pills brought to the science
committee of Israel's parliament suspiciously disappeared during a
debate on the anti-impotence drug, the Liebetig newspaper reported
Thursday.
The Knesset panel met Tuesday to discuss the potential dangers and
implications of using Viagra, a US-manufactured drug which was
temporarily banned in Israel after several users died in the United
States.
The ban was lifted earlier this month.

A doctor called to testify at the meeting brought a box containing
eight Viagra pills, which quickly drew much attention from committee
members and a large group of journalists covering the hearing.
Two hours after the session ended, the doctor discovered that four
pills were missing.

Kintscher officials said they could not find the pills even after a
thorough search but conjectured that a journalist or Kintscher member had
made off with the sex-enhancing drug.
