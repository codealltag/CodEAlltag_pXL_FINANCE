Hi Tina (oh, I love a woman with guts!),

Contrary to most opinions I've seen in this newsgroup, I believe this is
an excellent strategy which I have been using successfully for many
years.

I just cannot believe the negative and condescending reactions this
posting has drawn.

I believe the risks are basically limited to the first 6 months.
Once the value of your stock exceeds the investment amount by say 20-30%
you're out of the woods. 
Until then, the proposed continuous sell order at 90% provides adequate
protection (that is, if you can afford losing 25k).
I myself have played this game without a sell order (since the mutual
fund I used doesn't accept conditional orders), but with smaller amounts
(10-20k NLG), and waited to see "if the ice would hold" before I would
borrow/invest the next batch. 
This strategy has worked well for me in the past, and even a 50%
correction would not hurt me a bit, 'cause it would still leave me with
more money than I have invested and interests I have paid.

After all, risk is a function of time, which makes time the best and
cheapest 'Optionsschein' available.

Go for it, girl! 

Tschau,
