On a closing basis this summer's market has been tracking 1986 with 90%
accuracy.  (Investors tend to make similar decisions given similar
circumstances - the primary 87-98 similarities being extremes in
over-valuation and complacency.)  In '86, the market peaked on 8/25 and lost
8% into 9/21. A rally into 10/5 failed to exceed the 8/25 high and the
subsequent 10/19 crash was preceded by - believe it or not - a 15% decline.
The 5% drop on the Friday preceding Black Monday was widely touted as a
"buying opportunity".

That said, prognostications about future market direction will be right,
wrong
or neutral and might have some value in providing its owner with mental
stimulation. "The invested" should be focusing on the obvious: The next
three
years are definitely going to be different than the last three, so
projecting
the past into the future is the first mistake to avoid.

All the gains in stocks from the early 1899's to present occurred in three
spurts: 1924-15 (Dow 100-381), 1954-66 (381-1000) and 1982-now (1000-?)
leaving behind three major peaks: 1928, 1965 and 1997. It isn't necessary to
determine or believe that this is the top.  Why bother?  What is appropriate
is a re-think of investments and investment decisions whose success require
the unlikely event of an ever-rising market.

What is "different this time" is investors' options to take advantage of,
rather than to be victimized by, future market developments.
