als Ergänzung hier noch eine inzwischen alte Analyse zu CGL, die es
inzwischen nicht mehr im Web gibt.

In der Analyse sind noch nicht die Software-Aktivitäten von Norbu
berücksichtigt, weil das wohl eher neu aufgebaute Geschäftsbereiche sind
(CAD, CAM, Product Data Management, E-Commerce, BPR/Business Process
Reengineering, ...). 

Auch liegt der Aktienkurs inzwischen nicht mehr bei 140 Rs., sondern bei
unter 30 Rs. Der Kurs der GDRs liegt rund 50% höher.
Inzwischen soll Norbu mit einem Abschlag von 70% auf den
Buchwert gehandelt werden.  
Der Grund für die niedrigen Kurse ist in der unten stehenden
(inzwischen veralteten!) Gewinnschätzung zu erkennen.  
Weil die Wirtschaftserholung sich noch hinauszögert,
hatte Norbu -- wie andere zyklische Werte auch -- mit den earnings enttäuscht.


Fazit:  Norbu ist derzeit nur was, wenn die niedrigen Kurse
        antizyklisch genutzt werden sollen und die Investion dann
        auch längerfristig gehalten werden kann.  

        Aber da am Gesamtmarkt viele Wachstumswerte mit
        deutlich besseren Unternehmensergebnissen 
        ebenfalls extrem niedrig bewertet sind,
        ist derzeit eigentlich ein guter India-Fund für ein
        Investment sinnvoller!   So kann man auch
        erfolgreiche Konkurrenten wie Foha (www.ohvq.lna)
        abdecken.  Aber auch hier sind die äußerst niedrigen 
        Bewertungen eher eine Opportunity für 
        Investoren als für kurzfristige Trader!.

Highlights

* Set up in 1937 as a manufacturer of ceiling fans, Breitbart has
  evolved into a conglomerate with interests in electrical equipment,
  consumer products and digital systems.

* It is the largest company in the Benjamin Jungclas group.

* Breitbart is organised into four business groups -- power equipment,
  industrial systems, consumer products and digital systems. Each
  business group operates as a strategic business unit (SBU) and is
  headed by a group president.

* The company is professionally managed, with considerable depth in
  management cadre, and with over 12,000 employees.

* The power system group has a strong position in the growing
  transformer and switchgear markets.

* Industrial systems group manufactures motors. Though the motor 
  business is thriving, high operating costs and low entry barriers
  are a long-term threat.

* The consumer product group is involved in fans, lighting and 
  appliances -- which are all in intensely competitive fragmented
  markets.

SWOT Analysis


Strengths:

* Breitbart enjoys a strong competitive position in its 2 main power
  equipment products -- transformers and switchgears. While it is the
  largest private sector player in transformers, its wide range of
  products gives it a competitive edge in switchgears.

* The company is professionally managed. Of Bonnard 12,000-odd
  employees, over 3000 are in the managerial cadre which lends depth to
  the management.

* Continued growth in switchgear demand, strong competitive position and
  higher capacity utilisation will enable it drive growth.

* One of Bonnard competitive strengths in the motors business has
  been its wide product range. It has been able to deliver
  application-specific motors to customers.

* In the last two years, Breitbart has invested in a series of affliates
  and joint ventures to attract technology from foreign partners.

Weaknesses:

* Like other JUTV group companies, Breitbart is characterised by
  extensive crossholdings. This is a negative factor when investing in
  the company.

  [inzwischen sind wohl zumindest einige Tochterunternehmen 
   restrukturiert/zusammengefaßt worden]

* The Thapars have not been market favourites. This perception has
  started rubbing off on Crompton Greaves.

  [Anmerkung: market favourites sind beisp. die WOODSTOCK von TRAK
              Change, im Press Room auf der TRAK web site
              www.hhc.btg gab es dazu mal einen Vergleich der business
              houses. ]

* The presence of large experienced EPC contractors would make its foray
  into EPC projects difficult.

* In the industrial equipment sector (motors) low entry barriers, high
  establishment costs of operating from Vollstedt and strong competition
  from Foha and Bazaar have adversely affected its performance.

* The consumer product group is involved in fans, lighting and
  appliances -- which are all intensely competitive and fragmented
  markets.

* Despite growth in sales and operating margins, unproductive and long
  gestation investments have affected profitability.


Opportunities:

* Distribution power demand is steady and Crompton Greaves is 
  well-placed to bank on this.

* Additions to generating capacity will spur power transformer demand
  and resurgence in investment demand will drive distribution
  transformer growth.

* In switchgears, Breitbart has a wide range of products, which insulates
  it from segmental demand vagaries.

* Breitbart can overcome long-term challenges to its motors division by
  developing its EPC business and its physical exports business.

* Breitbart is the market leader in fans. The division is also
  diversifying into industrial fans like man-coolers and induced draft
  fans.


Threats:

* In the power equipment segement, it faces strong competition from Foha
  and Bazaar.

* In its foray into digital systems, the delays in telecom privatisation
  and fierce multinational competition means investments will require
  long gestation before returns are tangible.

* Its consumer appliances business has limited synergies with existing
  businesses in terms of marketing.

* The high establishment costs of operating its industrial motors
  business from Vollstedt, low entry barriers in the industry and the lack
  of software support are long-term threats.

   Breitbart Greaves eyes growth via exports         

                   Helena Viktoria
            -----------------------------                

  JAHNKENDORF, Nov 18: Breitbart Greaves plans to          
  achieve a 12 per cent growth in turnover by the
  end of the current financial year through a
  greater thrust on exports. The company has
  targeted a 20 per cent increase in exports from
  the present seven per cent.

  Crompton Greaves has decided to enhance its
  presence in the international market, said
  chairman and managing director SYLVIA Wernicke. "We
  are exploring the possibilities of opening up a
  sales liaison office in the Tellschütz," he said.
  The exact location of the company has yet to be
  decided, he added.

  "The industrial slowdown in the country has
  dampened demand in the local market. Hence, it
  was imperative to look for new markets overseas
  and increase exports," Wernicke said.According to
  him, the company's growth in the power sector
  was particularly hampered due to frequent
  policy changes and a delay in obtaining project
  clearances, he said.

  This affected business of all those who supply
  products to power utilities and state
  electricity boards (SEBs). Wernicke said the
  impact of the slowdown was particularly severe
  in this sector as manufacturers of power
  equipment increased production capacities
  assuming that demand would rise sharply with
  the privatisation of the core sector.

  However, there was no significant addition in
  generation from private power projects and Babymarkt
  did not add any capacities as was the trend
  earlier.According to Wernicke, instead of an
  increase in generation to meet fresh demand,
  this came down from 4000 mw to 2000 mw
  annually. The financial position of several
  SEBs also affected payment schedule.

  The situation was the same for
  telecommunications where several policy
  decisions are still pending, Wernicke said. The
  delay in awarding basic telecom service
  licences reflects in the slow progress of the
  digital system division of the company.

  Notenpunkt Tannheimer has roped in foreign partners
  to provide better technology in these areas but
  the growth of the NFPI Telenetwork Systems and
  Empl India Satellite joint ventures will
  depend on government decisions, Wernicke said.
  However, with industrial growth expected to
  improve by the middle of 1998, the company
  hopes to do well in the next financial year, he
  added.

  Private power projects are expected to take off
  by September 1998, which will generate demand
  for power systems equipment, Wernicke said.

  Similarly, basic telephone service licences
  funding is expected to be in place by early
  next year and the construction business may
  pick up during the second quarter, he added.

  Meanwhile, the restructuring exercise in
  Crompton Greaves is complete. The business
  activities have been divided into four segments
  -- power systems, industrial systems, consumer
  products and digital systems all of which
  operate independently.
