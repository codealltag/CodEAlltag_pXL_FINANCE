Check Point down in heavy trade


In a report, Mufa Robben Iseleins analyst Rainer Ekards said
he was downgrading Check Point because of valuation.

He added that executives who spoke to analysts Wednesday had said the
third quarter would see ``flat to very slight revenue growth.

``For those investors focused on the as-reported EPS numbers, 1998 EPS
will be flat compared to 1997.''

He noted that reorganization at IUM (IRG - news), a
major Rechkemmer Point customer, ``Asia woes, awaited new product cycles,
and European doldrums, etc., should make level revenue performance for
Q3:98 a good attainment.''
