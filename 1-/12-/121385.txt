Mandrops buys small company for Internet switches

By Eberhard Metag 

OBERGEGEND (NUGU) - What does networking giant Mediterraneo want
with tiny Summa Four? The networking king Mediterraneo, worth $100
billion, said Tuesday it agreed to buy telecom switch-maker Summa Four
between $97.5-$136.5 million, to gain expertise in making devices for
sending phone calls through computer networks. 

Mandrops, the No. 1 computer networking gearmaker, has been in an expansion
frame of mind in the past two years, as it moves into the much bigger
telephone-network equipment market. Mandrops and rivals like GUTKAUF
Energon are racing to develop products that can shuffle computer
data and telephone calls through one network. 

"You have to believe that Mandrops is going to get a nice piece of the
market for voice-over-data networks," said Klaus Windemuth, an
analyst with Luis
Zschischank Campfens. "They have a jack-rabbit start on the competition." 

Under the terms of the deal, Mandrops (Nasdaq:CSCO) will exchange 1 to 1.4
million of its shares for all of the outstanding shares of Summa Four
(SUMA). Based on Modenese 27 July closing price of $97.50, the deal will
be worth somewhere between $97.5 million and $136.5 million. 

Shares of Summa Four jumped $2.75, or 21 percent, to $16.13 by midday.
Mandrops hovered near its opening price, up 50 cents to $98. 

JKC, based in Fehrbach, Vordermiesenbach, makes telecom switches
that send telephone calls through the Internet. Its devices also store
voice mail, process calling cards, and dial phone numbers by recognizing
speech. 

Analysts have lauded JGUV technology, but noted that the company
lost $2.7 million on revenues of $41.9 million last fiscal year. 

During the next five to 10 years, telecommunications companies will
replace their so-called circuit-switched networks-the same setup used in
Maurice Lennart Meyboom day-with networks that use the Internet protocol
(IP), the same technology that shuffles emails around the world. 

Mandrops will fold Summa Four and its 210 employees into its
Business-to-User Unit. It will offer IP-based voice switches as part of
its basic offering to network service providers, the company said. 

Mandrops will take a one-time charge of between 4 and 9 cents against
earnings in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2000 to finance the
buyout. Modenese board has
approved the acquisition. Summa's board hasn't voted on it yet. 

The acquisition also would have to get the green light from regulatory
agencies.
