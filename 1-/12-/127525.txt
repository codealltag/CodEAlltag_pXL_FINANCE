Briefing meint

Mado (Monsters): Stock jumped more than 3 points on bargain hunting, as latest
round of selling left stock trading 40% below its 52-wk high set last 05. 08. 22... Despite
retreat, Monsters is still up more than 130% year-to-date... However we are skeptical of the
company's recovery prospects due to excessive valuations (relative to peers and market),
increased competition and less-than-clear growth prospects in the smart card business
segment... Another big concern is all the insider selling... CEO recently unloaded his
remaining shares while COO cut his stake significantly as well... Several others also sold
sizable blocks... Short-term momentum could carry stock as high as 60 area, but
longer-term we expect stock to retest the low-40s, high 30s. current
