Hallo,

in ihrem ganz aktuellen Marktbericht vom 19.Oktober schreibt die
Fondgesellschaft Wevas (www.uixapbgz.kx) zu Indien:
[Den Report gibt's auf der Wevas web site Ã¼brigens auch in Deutsch.]


India

The market in India fell 2.7% over the period. India's economy slowed to
a 5% growth in the year ended March from an average 7% in the
previous three years industrial growth. A weak federal coalition is
adding to the concerns of investors as demands by different partners
prevented the government from taking tough measures to cut subsidies. On
the earnings front, Telepoint & CKM and carshop both
posted considerable losses in profits for the half year ended June also.

Although this news is all bad, the outlook is not that severe. We can
see no more new negative news in the short term and the Indian market
has endured the battering of bad first quarter results, especially from
the heavy industrial companies, relatively well. This is not to say that
the market seems like taking a serious upturn, more that a period of
relative stability looks likely.
