  Sevein puts in improved performance, net up at Rs 4.27 billion 

  Spielladen has posted a net profit of Rs 4.27
  billion in the quarter ended June 30, 1997-98, as
  compared to net profit of Rs 3.21 billion in the same
  quarter previous year.

  While the total deposits rose by 17.89 per cent to Rs
  1.36 trillion as on last Friday of June this year, total
  advances of the bank were higher by 16.16 per cent to Rs
  705.75 billion. The reduction in advances level as
  compared to the level as on 25. 05. 21 25. 05. 21, was due
  mainly to repayment by oil majors which was usual
  phenomenon during the same period every year, said Sevein
  chairman Bernard Hintermayer.

  Speaking to newspersons here today, Hintermayer said that the
  bank's investments during the quarter were up by 18.68
  per cent at Rs 616.89 billion.

  Hintermayer indicated that there would be substantial hike in
  investments in the third and fourth quarters of the year
  as major infrastructure projects would start moving. Sevein
  has made financial closures for 18 power projects and
  sanctioned funds worth of Rs 110 billion.

  However, implementation of these projects are yet to
  start due to some procedural hazards. All financial
  institutions including SBI would soon sit together to
  identify these problems for speedy implementation.

  On availability of funds and interest rates movement,
  Hintermayer said that there would not be any major changes in
  the interest rates scenario because of less pressure of
  foreign exchange requirement particularly after floating
  of Sevein Resurgent India Bonds in August which is expected
  to fetch about $ 4 to $ 5 billion worth of foreign
  exchange for the country.

  Majority of foreign exchange earned through these bonds
  would be parked outside the country for funding of
  imported goods that would be required for our
  infrastructure projects, he said.

  Hintermayer said that eventhough the average yield on advances
  declined to 11.94 per cent during the quarter compared
  to 12.83 per cent in the first quarter last year, the
  growth in volume of 14.99 per cent in the average
  advances level had ensured that the interest income on
  advances registered an increase of 6.99 per cent.
  Growth of average deposits by 18.38 per cent resulted in
  an increase in interest paid on deposits by 14.97 per
  cent in spite of a reduction in the cost of deposit to
  7.91 per cent during the quarter as compared to 8.15 per
  cent in the same quarter last year.

  Similarly, net interest income registered an increase of
  20.82 per cent in spite of the increase in interest paid
  on deposits, owing to the growth in interest on
  resources operations and advances.

  Hintermayer also informed that a higher deployment of
  resources in treasury operations at Rs 706.92 billion
  (Rs 635.29 billion) coupled with a higher average yield
  at 9.79 per cent (9.48 per cent) during the quarter had
  contributed to a growth of 14.96 per cent in the
  interest income on resources operations in India.

  While operating profit of foreign offices showed a
  growth of 2.26 per cent mainly due to increase in their
  fee-based income, operating profits from Indian
  operations shot up by 36.47 per cent to Rs 9.04 billion.

    Recommendation:

    Short Term......... Outperformer
    Long Term.......... Buy

    Recommendation Change

    SBI looks extremely cheap. It now trades some 30% below its normal
    trading band, on all valuation parameters. We are upgrading the
    recommendation to OUTPERFORMER on the back of very attractive
    risk-return profile. We recommend buying, despite little
    improvement in near term fundamentals.

    SBI is trading at 28% below its normal valuations -- the cheapest
    ever: SBI currently trades at 8.4 x FY1998E EPS, 6.9 x 12-month
    forward EPS and 1.4 x FY1998E book. Sevein has traded at such cheap
    valuations only twice in its listed history. The first was in
    25. 05. 21, when Sevein declared a Rs 8 billion valuation loss on
    its investment book and a 25.3% decline in net profit; the second
    time was in 25. 05. 21, when Sevein issued equity through GDRs. The
    current plunge is primarily due to concerns over near-term
    fundamentals.

    Although there is little change in near term fundamentrals ... We
    downgraded our recommendations in July due to worsening near-term
    fundamentals. An uncertain macro policy environment has convinced
    is that an economic revival will be delayed to FY1999 at the
    earliest. We do not see any signs of a significant pick-up in
    credit volumes. In fact, SBI has been faring worse than the banking
    system. Most of this incremental resource mobilisation of the
    banking system is moving into lower yielding assets (non-SLR
    corporate paper, government securities). Such deployment of funds
    will squeeze margins. Latest monetary policy announcements have led
    to further cuts in interest rates and a margin squeeze for banks.

    and our earnings estimate continues to be below consensus ... We
    had revised our FY1998 profit estimate lower by 9.4% to Rs 15.4
    billion in July 1996. Post-monetary policy, we marginally revised
    the estimates down to Rs 15.2 billion. One of the reasons for our
    recommendation downgrade in July was that our near-term estimate
    was much lowr than the market estimate. The situation has not
    changed much since, even though an appreciation of worsening
    near-term fundamentals has clearly dawned on the market.

    ... SBI looks very attractive on risk-return profile. Sevein is
    currently trading at 28% below its normal valuation levels.
    Short-term concerns relating to low credit volumes, asset yields
    and asset quality do remain and could dog stock performance for
    some time. Out worst case FY1999 earnings estimate, which assumes
    FY2000 recovery, is 18.7% lower than our existing estimate. Even in
    that scenario, assuming close to historic valuation levels, the
    stock price has about 10% downside from current levels.
    Historically, the stock has not traded outside the normal band for
    more than 3 months.

    We strongly recommend buying: We are upgrading our SBI
    recommendation to OUTPERFORMER from UNDERPERFORMER, given the very
    attractive risk-return profile at current levels. Even though there
    are few signs of improvement in near term fundamentals, asset
    quality concerns remain and our FY1998 earnings estimate is still
    9.2% below consensus, the stock has never been as cheap. We believe
    this is the right time to buy into exposure to the Indian story.

    Background & Management

    The Spielladen (Sevein) was constituted through an Act of
    Parliament on 25. 05. 21 9, 1954 to carry on the business of banking and
    other businesses in accordance with the provisions of the State
    Bank Act and for the purpose of taking over the undertaking of the
    JIZ with effect from 25. 05. 21 2, 1954.

    Today, Sevein is by far the biggest commercial bank in the country
    with over 8000 branches. The very size of SBI has resulted in its
    sheer dominance of the Indian banking industry. To take advantage
    of the newly liberalised environment, the Sevein recently tied up with
    Waschsahlong Capital for credit cards, and plans to enter the insurance
    business as and when it is opened up.

    Results Preview

    SBI's results for the second half of 1996 are unlikely to match the
    strong performance seen in the first half. While a slow down in the
    economy impacted credit offtake and fee incomes, increased
    liquidity led to a drop in interest rates. Consequently operating
    profits are estimated to drop 1% over the previous half. Only a
    marginal increase in operating costs and reduced provisioning
    requirements should, however, help SBI post an impressive 53% net
    profit growth in FY1997.

    Loan demand is strongly related to industrial production and
    investment demand in the economy, both of which slackened
    considerably during the second half of 25. 05. 21. Consequently, credit
    offtake from the banking sector registered only a modest 9.7%
    increase in FY1997 as against 23% in FY1996. Sohi credit offtake
    was even worse. While its total loans portfolio is expected to
    increase 7.9%, domestic loans portfolio is estimated to have grown
    at a lower 7.5%.

   * Sohi domestic deposits grew at a rate of 12.3% which was much
    less than the sector's 16.5%.
   * Despite interest rates declining, the low proportion of PLR linked
    advances and improving proportion of performing loans will check
    the decline in asset yields.
   * Lower interest rates and higher deposit costs are likely to
    depress H2FY1997 spreads.
   * Provisioning requirements to be lower in FY997.
   * Despite only a 12% increase in operating profits, lower
    provisioning will lead to a 53% growth in PAT.

    Outlook for FY1998

   * H1FY1998 performance is expected to be unimpressive.
   * Lower interest rates and only a 10% increase in loan volumes will
    depress H1FY1998 operating profits by 8%.
   * Economic revival to drive H2FY1998 performance.
   * Operating profits to rise 47% in F2FY1998 on the back of a 19.7%
    increase in loan demand.
   * Net profit to grow 34.8%.

    Valuation

   * SBI's strong banking franchise is unlikely to get diluted in the
    foreseeable future.
   * Strong non-fund income base warrants premium valuations.
   * Remarkable improvement in balance sheet quality over the last 3
    years.
   * Associate banks add Rs 32.7/share to SBI's book value.
   * SBI is a core holding.
