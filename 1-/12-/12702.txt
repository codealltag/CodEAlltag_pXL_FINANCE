Poker Tells Randomize
Author Carer
Should you check or
raise? Should you
just call or fire all
your chips at the
pot? Should you play a
hand or fold it? In poker
you face these and other
decisions routinely. Top
poker strategists correctly
will tell you that
you shouldn't make the
same decision every time
the same or a very similar
situation arises.
You need to randomize
so that alert opponents
won't be comfortable in
planning a counter strategy
based on your predictability.
The more opponents
can correctly guess
how you're playing a
hand, the more likely you
are to suffer financially.
This is true in both limit
and no-limit poker games.
In limit hold 'em games,
if you always raise with
aces from an early position
and never with anything
else, skillful opponents
will eventually grow
wise. They will fold most
big hands when you raise,
denying you the profit you
expect.
If you never play small,
unpaired cards from the
dealer position, opponents
can discount any possibility
that you might have
combined with the board
to make a small straight.
But if you play those
unlikely cards occasionally
- even just once in a
hundred opportunities -
your opponents can never
be absolutely certain what
you hold at the moment.
The science
The science that accompanies
this randomization
of decisions is steeped in
careful analysis of both
decisions and opposing
responses -- and in game
theory. The truth is, if
you hope to compete in
the high-tension world of
big-league poker, you've
got to do the unexpected
sometimes.
But you can't do it too
often. If you do, you'll
stray so far from what
is the best, most-obvious
choices that you'll
be playing too poorly to
win. So, yes, randomize.
But don't be cute more
times than are dictated
by your need to confuse
opponents. The choice you
should make most often
is the one that seems the
most compelling. Some
players - even world class
players - fall into the
bad habit of mixing up
their play more than they
must. Doing that just eats
away at their bankrolls.
It becomes what I've
defined as "Fancy Play
Syndrome" (FPS) - the
practice of too often looking
for an unusual way to
play a hand when the most
obvious, straightforward
choice is better. FPS is a
contagious disease - one
that you should take precautions
not to acquire.
Now that I've told you
that it's necessary to be
versatile in your poker
decisions, while sticking
to the basic best choices
as much as possible,
there's something else you
need to know. There are
times when you shouldn't
randomize your poker
decisions at all. And nothing
drives home this point
better than a short lecture
I gave years ago. Here is
the text of that lesson...
When not to
randomize
Today we're going to talk
about randomizing your
poker decisions. You've
heard it time and time
again, right? In order to
win at poker, you've got
to randomize your actions,
don't do the same thing all
the time, change speeds,
shift gears.
But I'm going to tell
you a secret. Sometimes
it's wrong to change
gears. Sometimes it's not
profitable to randomize.
Listen. The truth is that
most of the time the only
reason we should randomize
is to put our opponents
off-guard and to keep
them guessing.
For each common poker
situation, usually there's a
very strong play we'd like
to use every single time,
but if we use it too often,
we're afraid our opponents
will catch on and
adapt.
So, we choose to be
deceptive. One way to be
deceptive is to randomize
our poker decisions.
Maybe we want to raise
every time we have strong
hands and never raise
otherwise. Fine, but we're
afraid our opponents will
soon catch on. We fear
they'll fold whenever we
raise, because it's obvious
that we have them beat.
What to do? The
answer, of course, is to
sometimes just call with
these monster hands and

sometimes raise with
weaker hands. That will
fool our opponents.
Not aware
But what if our opponents
are too unaware to be
fooled? What if they're
just weak players who
aren't paying any attention
at all to what we're doing?
Ah, there's the point.
Against weak players who
aren't paying attention,
it's almost always better
not to randomize. Just
make that raise every time
with your strong hands.
Everywhere, on every
planet, every place poker
is played, it's a powerful
truth that players who
randomize their decisions
without having a good
reason are simply costing
themselves profit. That's
important, and I'll repeat
it. Players who randomize
without a reason lose
profit.
If you know what
you're strongest play is,
but you randomize and
you're not sure why,
you're usually costing
yourself money. When
you're against weak opponents,
be less deceptive,
choose your strongest
play, stick to it, don't randomize.

today.
