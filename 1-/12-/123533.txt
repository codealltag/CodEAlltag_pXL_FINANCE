    Holzkamm has announced its plans to take over the privately owned
    MSCI (Modeparadies), a company that generates roughly DM
20
Million in
    revenues. Modeparadies whose employees number 55, is currently not
profitable,
the reason being
    that its aged owners have maintained a two-shift production schedule

while in this
    particular market segment (low-volume printing jobs from customers
like
food retailers,
    local newspapers, but also dedicated mailings by catalogue
publishers),
because of
    relatively high fixed costs, at least three shifts are required to
run
a profitable operation.
    For FFI, Modeparadies with its modern production facilities (two
medium-sized, web-fed
    offset printing machines) looks like a perfect fit as it complements

its own facilities
    ideally. In one stroke Holzkamm will have acquired state-of-the art
printing machines (no
    modernisation investments required at all), on balance (plans are to

sell the current only
    such machine ), located just a short distance from its own
operations
at Weihern and
    Christenberg will have tripled its web-fed offset printing capacities,
allowing the company to
    offer a wider range of services to its established clients while at
the
same time taking
    over MANUEL?s customer base. Holzkamm intends to run these facilities at
a
three-shift
    schedule. It should be noted though, that the bulk of Holzkamm?s
revenues are generated
    by the more profitable intaglio printing with total offset printing
having contributed just
    6.8% to 1997 revenues.

    This transaction, not yet finalised and also subject to supervisory
board approval is
    planned to become effective next 06. 03. 22 10. Therefore there 1998
results at Holzkamm will
    not (!) be affected.

    No further details are available regarding the terms of the deal.
The
company did mention
    though that there will be no loss carry-forward, and that in 1999,
KRO
is expected to
    show an increase in sales and, on account of the planned three
shift-
schedule there
    should also be a positive contribution to consolidated earnings. We
also expect some
    additional debt to be assumed to finance the take-over. However, for

the time being we
    leave our current earnings estimates unchanged until further details

become available.

    We want to point out, that under the current scenario (not including

KRO) we estimate
    pre-tax margins to improve steadily from 8.3% in 1998 to 9.3% in the

year 2000. The
    reduction of estimated net earnings is solely due to the higher tax
rate as the company is
    likely to have used up its loss-carryforward from the acquisition of

EroticMarkt GmbH
    (formerly named MÃ¤chtel GmbH). In the year 2000 under the
(realistic)
    assumption of a 50% dividend pay-out the tax rate should recede
again
leading to record
    earnings, not counting the contribution of the then fully integrated

current takeover
    candidate.

    After its record high of DM 54.50 last April 5, the stock has lost
about 20% of its value
    since. Having climbed from its January-low of DM 30 we attribute
this
to profit taking in
    an environment where low-tech mid-cap companies have been out of
favour. With the
    good business outlook, potentially being even brighter on account of

the planned
    acquisition and the high dividend yield, we reiterate our overweight

recommendation with
    a fair stock-price of DM 70 - DM 78.
