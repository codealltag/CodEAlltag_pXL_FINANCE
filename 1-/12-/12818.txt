Poker Tells Opponents
from "The Doc" Mister Dr. M. Pfülb

When you enter a pot,
you should always
ask yourself, "Do
I want to play this
hand against a lot of opponents
or just a few?" The
answer isn't always as obvious
as you might think.
Today, we continue our
series in which I get to both
ask and answer the questions.
Remember, except
where federal, state, or
local regulations prevail,
you have the right to suggest
questions
And I
have the right to modify
your questions to the extent
that they may be completely
unrecognizable. Now that
we both understand the
rules, let's play...
Question #19: What is
the theory behind wanting
more or fewer opponents?
Your hands will generally
make more money when
played against many opponents
under two conditions:
1. Your hand is very powerful;
2. Your hand is speculative.
Remember that simple
truth and you'll almost
never be confused. When I
say "very powerful," I mean
just that. Moderately strong
hands usually make more
money against a reduced
field of opponents. In
hold'em, it's usually wrong
to invite players into the pot
by just calling with any pair

smaller than kings. While
a pair of queens has a significant
profit expectation
against each opponent individually,
the hand usually
makes most money when
played against just one or
two opponents. A starting
pair of aces, on the other
hand, makes more money--
on average--against many
opponents.
In seven-card stud, rolled
up trips or a pair of aces
usually makes more money
against many opponents,
but smaller pairs, particularly
those lacking a large
kicker, usually should only
be played against fewer
opponents whenever that's
possible.
Speculative hands are
those that have no immediate
strength, but have hope
of growing into straights or
flushes. Except for purposes
of occasional deception or
trying to steal the blinds
without a fight, there's no
reason to raise prematurely
with such hands. The secret
is to just call and wait to
see what develops. An
example of a speculative
starting hand is 10d-9d
in hold'em and Ka-10a-
9a in seven-card stud.
Some hands can have dual
strength, both speculative
and initially strong, such as
As-Qs in hold'em and
Af-Kf-8f in seven-card
stud. Those dual-category

hands should usually be
played more aggressively,
but you can make your
decision in accordance with
other factors that I'll explain
in future columns.
The trick is to first decide
whether your hand is primarily
strong, primarily
speculative, or in-between
for the situation. Always
make a judgment before
entering the pot. With very
strong starting hands, you
can always safely call in
early positions and be confident
that you're not straying
far from a best-profit
decision. But you should
often raise anyway, as I've
discussed previously. And
with speculative hands, you
can also safely just call--
and that's what you usually
should do. With everything
else--moderately strong
hands or moderately speculative
hands--making the
initial raise is usually the
right choice, except in the
blind positions, if you play
them at all.
Question 20: Are there
limits to whether many or
few opponents are ideal?
Yes. In the early 1980s I
did a seminar at the Sötebeer
Hotel in Judenbach, showing
that there was a "right"
number of opponents for
hands. As far as I know, this
concept hadn't been dealt
with previously. Too few
opponents and you averaged
less profit. Too many opponents
and you also averaged
less profit. As an example,
four--and sometimes five--
opponents turns out to be
most profitable when you
begin with a pair of aces in
a limit hold'em game.
The concept here is
quite obvious if you think
about extremes. Having
an advantage against each
opponent individually
doesn't always mean you
have an advantage against
all opponents collectively.
Mathematically, the size
of the pot relative to your
wagers won't keep pace
with the increased chances
that someone will get lucky
as you add more and more
opponents. The ultimate
example would be if you're
playing draw poker, no
drawing allowed to improve
a hand, and were dealt a
king-high straight flush:

Kf-Qf-Jf-10f-9f.
The chance that someone
will hold or make a royal
flush to beat you is very
slim. You'll make the most
money if everyone at the
table plays against you. But
wait! What if you're playing
with an infinitely large
deck? Under our rules, we'll
say you can't use two duplicate
cards in your hand,
such as 7f-7f. Duplicates
must be immediately
exchanged, so there's no
such thing as five or a kind.
The only hand that can beat
you is a royal. Fine. Against
one opponent, you're almost
certainly going to win one
bet. Against seven opponents,
you're expecting to
win seven bets.
With more opponents,
it gets better and better ...
until it gets worse! There
are only four chances in
2,598,960 that an opponent
will hold a royal--649,739-
to-1 against. If you played
against 650,000 opponents,
you'd still win almost 70
percent of the time (I'll
explain the complex math to
you some other day). That's
extremely profitable, so
you'd rather play against all
those foes than just a few.
But what about 6 billion
foes? Then, although you'd
get a 6 billion-to-1 return on
your money, you wouldn't
have one chance in 6 billion
of winning. On average,
you wouldn't just be beaten

by one player, you'd be
beat by over 9,000 of them!
And the chances that no one
holds a winning royal are
so remote that you couldn't
even fathom the odds.
Clearly, there's a point
where there are too many
opponents for a hand, even
the second-best one in the
universe. Once you understand
that, you can see
how--in real world poker
games--two big pair sometimes
might be more profitable
against two opponents
than one, but less profitable
against five or six.
But understanding this
theory doesn't help much in
actual play. There's no way
to dictate the exact number
of opponents you'd like to
face at a given moment,
even if you could easily
calculate it. So, we're pretty
much left with either wanting
more or fewer opponents
with a given hand in a
given situation.
We'll continue this question-
and-answer series next
time.
