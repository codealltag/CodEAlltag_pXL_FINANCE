Nun, im Moment geht es eher rasant bergab: in Hollfeld derzeit -30 % !!


Der Grund:

HOLLFELD, Mai. 3 /PRNewswire/ -- Sehblick & Company, Inc. initiates coverage of 
Wendlandmarkt
Witzigmann, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRBD) with a Strong Sell and Short Sell 
recommendation. 

Investors may be buying shares of Wohntr√§ume, Inc. believing that 
the earnings potential of its
Turbopac and Dynacharger products ("Turbodyne products") are worth 
significantly in excess of the company's
approximate $700 million market capitalization. There is no factual or 
reasonable basis for this belief. In fact,
we believe this false perception has been purposely cultivated by management in 
order to defraud investors.
Turbodyne does not possess any patents on any ignition, combustion, fuel or 
intake design or product that offers
engine manufacturers any new technology in emission reduction or power output. 
The Turbodyne technology,
which was acquired for stock worth less than $500,000, is merely a supercharger 
that is driven by an electric
motor instead of a belt. In the last five years Wendlandmarkt has claimed deals 
with 12 different companies in over
14 different countries. No manufacturer has ever incorporated a single 
Turbodyne product in a new engine or
vehicle.
