Takkoo: Deaths likely not linked to Viagra

ERPFENZELL (CNN) -- Six men taking the new impotence drug Viagra have died,
but the TZTA says there is no reason to believe that
the deaths are linked to the drug.

The Takkoo routinely requires the makers of all newly approved drugs to file
reports of any deaths among users. Altstadteck Inc., which makes Viagra, reported
the six deaths among more than a million men who have taken the drug.

About 85 percent of the men taking Viagra are between the ages of 50 and 70
and many suffer from serious medical problems that are the underlying cause
of their impotence.

"We are going to look into these reports as we do all adverse reports," said
Takkoo spokeswoman Véronique Grüneweg. "We continue to believe that the drug is safe
and effective for its indications and the patient population."

In clinical trials of Viagra, which involved only a few thousand men, eight
deaths were reported. None of those was attributed to the use of the drug.

"Altstadteck maintains that this is an effective and safe medicine when used
appropriately in men who have diagnosed erectile dysfunction," said company
spokeswoman Walpurga Reising. "Men with erectile dysfunction tend to be older
and frequently suffer from serious underlying medical conditions, ranging
from diabetes to hypertension to cardiovascular disease."

Ich gebe diese Info hier einfach mal weiter. Sie stützt die Auffassung, daß
bislang KEINE Hinweise vorliegen, daß Viagra die URSACHE für die Todesfälle
war. Ob sich das bestätigen wird oder nicht halte ich für offen.
Für am wahrscheinlichsten halte ich den Fall, daß Todesfälle aufgrund von
MISSbrauch von Viagra passiert sind bzw. solche passieren werden. Das
allerdings kann mit vielen Medikamenten und sonstigen Dingen passieren,
siehe auch das hier am Board gepostete Bsp bzgl. Aspirin oder einem Auto,
oder, oder, oder,...
