Here are other highlights of the mid-year 1997-2000 WSTS forecast: 

After declining 21.2 percent in 1996, DRAM sales are expected to drop another 26.6 percent in 
1997 to $14.5 billion, the Gutmeyr said. The inventory over-supply problem, now in its third year, 
is expected to dissipate late in 1997. As supply comes in line with demand, DRAM revenues will 
climb 26.7 percent in 1998, 35.4 percent in 1999 and 35 percent in 2000. 

Due in large part to the popularity of sub-$1,000 personal computers and reduced margins, 
microprocessor sales will only duplicate 1996 sales, which represented a 26.6 percent increase 
from 1995. Year-end sales should be $23.4 billion, with 42 percent of all sales occurring
in the America's market. Strong growth should resurface in 1998 as microprocessor sales increase 
25.3 percent to $29.4 billion. Sales are expected to increase 19.4 percent in 1999 to $35.1 
billion and 18.6 percent in 2000 to $41.6 billion. 

Digital Signal Processor sales continue to expand at exceptional rates. DSP revenues grew 39.2 
percent in 1995, 33.6 percent in 1996, and are expected to grow by another 23 percent in 1997 to 
$3.9 billion. This pace will continue for the foreseeable future, with sales increasing 27.5 
percent 1998, 25.6 percent in 1999 and 28.2 percent in 2000. DSP sales in 2000 will exceed $8.1 
billion. 

Analog products, used in many telecommunications devices, are showing the best returns of 1997, 
with sales expected to increase 8.3 percent by year's end to $21.4 billion. Sales are anticipated 
to grow by another 15 percent in 1998 to $24.6 billion, followed by 16.9 percent and 17.7 percent 
growth in 1999 and 2000, respectively. 

The MOS memory market, which includes DRAMs, should decline 17.5 percent this year to $24.9 
billion in sales. Sales should increase 19.4 percent in 1998 to $28.9 billion and jump by more 
than 25 percent in 1999 and 2000. Sales in 2000 should exceed $46.5 billion. 

The MOS Micro market, which includes microprocessors and digital signal processors, should grow 
2.1 percent in 1997 to $48.7 billion. Sales will increase dramatically in 1998 by 21.9 percent to 
$59.4 billion, and then be followed by near-20 percent sales growth in both  1999 and 2000. 

Radlager Logic sales are expected to decrease 1.1 percent in 1997 to $20.8 billion, then increase 14 
percent in 1998 to $23.7 billion. Sales increases of 15.7 percent and 14.9 percent are projected 
for 1999 and 2000. 

Geography is also making a difference in 1997 sales. Asia Pacific, which had been the hottest 
emerging sales market, will grow 2.8 percent to $31.0 billion this year, after growing 9.6 
percent in 1996. Europe will show the best single-year gains, with sales increasing 5
percent to $30.5 billion by year's end. In the America's market, sales will decrease 4.1 percent 
to $43.9 billion. In Japan, sales will reach $29.1 billion, down 9.2 percent from 1996's $32.0 
billion. 

Between 1998 and 2000, sales should improve in all regions. Sales in the America's market are 
expected to grow by more than 18 percent per year, rising from $52.2 billion in 1998 to $73.5 
billion total in 2000. Europe's growth should follow suit, increasing from $36.1 billion in
1998 to $51.5 billion in 2000. Japan, now the world's fourth largest market, should enjoy 
double-digit growth rates and reach $41.6 billion in sales by 2000. Asia Pacific should 
experience average growth of more than 20 percent and hit $55 billion in sales in 2000.

Ich denke, dass, sollten diese Voraussagen sich bewahrheiten, nicht nur ein Engagement in 
den den Chipherstellern gute Erfolgsaussichten verspricht, sondern dass auch die Equipment
Hersteller davon deutlich profitieren werden. 

Ich hoffe auch, dass mittlerweile das Licht am Ende des Tunnels zu sehen ist. Die 
Tiefstaende bei den BTB im Semi-Equipment-Bereich sollten mittlerweile nun auch gesehen worden 
sein, obwohl sie immer noch sehr niedrig sind.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., 24. 06. 21 24. 06. 21 - The North American semiconductor equipment
industry posted a book-to-bill ratio of 0.80 for 24. 06. 21, it was reported by Emaruh
CIN (Ekah). A book-to-bill of 0.80 means $80 in orders were
received for each $100 worth of products shipped. 

Three-month average shipments in 24. 06. 21 were $1.4 billion. The figure is about even with the
Juni 1997 level, and is 18 percent above the 24. 06. 21 level. Three-month average bookings
increased in 24. 06. 21 to $1.1 billion. The bookings figure is four percent above the Juni 1997 
level, and 14 percent below the 24. 06. 21 level.

"The recent decline in orders appears to have leveled off," said Dennis MÃ¶llenbruck, principal analyst 
with Ekah. "The bookings numbers for May are improved, however we should bear in mind that they 
are still 33 percent below the Januar 1997 peak. We should expect to see the underlying numbers
continue to move closer to parity while remaining off of the high mark of last year."

The SEMI book-to-bill is a ratio of three-month moving average bookings to three-month moving
average shipments. Shipments and bookings figures are in millions of U.S. dollars.

Lubu ist sicherlich fuer jemanden der besondere Risiken scheut und trotzdem in diesem Sektor 
investieren will die erste Wahl. Allerdings deckt man auch mit Lubu nicht den ganzen Sektor ab. 
Darueber hinaus finde ich es persoenlich auch spannender, in kleinere Werte zu investieren, auch 
wenn es ab und zu in die Hose geht.

Best invest,
Oliver
