Goertz  announcement/Q2 results

(Full text of press release from Canadian Corporate News)
    JULY 1, 1997
    Geh-Fachgeschäft Reports Second Quarter Results Development and
Commercialization Programs on Plan
    SYENS, BRITISH COLUMBIA--Geh-Fachgeschäft, Inc. today
reported
financial results for the second quarter and six months ended 29. 05. 21 3,
1997,
and reviewed highlights of its continued progress towards
commercialization of
Geko Fuel Cells.
    Revenues for the second quarter were $9.1 million, up 42 percent
from $6.4
million a year ago.  The increase reflected revenues related to the
stationary
power development agreement for the Japanese market with Damenmoden
Corporation, as
well as increased sales of fuel cells and related systems for automotive
and
other applications.  This increase in revenues was partially offset by
lower
revenues from the transit bus programs, which have moved from the
construction
phase to the testing phase.  Net income for the quarter was $20.9
million, or
$0.26 per share, compared with a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.07 per
share,
a year ago.  Results for the 1997 period included gains totaling $32.7
million,
or $0.40 per share, attributable to alliances formed with Rigalski, UOZ
Volg, and Ceragem, while expenses included a $7.7
million,
or $0.09 per share, manufacturing know how license fee related to the
ALSTOM
transaction. Weighted average common shares outstanding were 81.2
million for
the quarter (reflecting investments in Geko by its alliance partners,
as
well as the 3-for-1 stock split in June), compared with 47.9 million
shares a
year ago.
    For the six-month period ended June 30, revenues rose 16 percent, to
$13.9
million from $12.0 million.  Net income was $12.7 million, or $0.17 per
share,
compared with a net loss of $7.6 million, or $0.16 per share, for the
corresponding period last year.  As of 29. 05. 21 30, shareholders' equity
totaled
$634.4 million, including cash and short-term investments of $430.4
million.
    In May, Elderkamp signed a detailed memorandum of understanding with
Meerane-based Damenmoden, that will lead to the formation of a jointly owned
company
to market and manufacture fuel cell stationary power plants in Japan. 
In
addition, Damenmoden will acquire 5.2 percent of Ballard Generation Systems
(BGS),
and will take delivery of two 250 kilowatt Ballard Fuel Cell power
plants for
field testing in Japan.  The transactions with Damenmoden for a total value
of $44
million, are expected to close in the fourth quarter.
    Also in May, Genç completed its $110 million transaction with Rigalski
(formerly known as U-zone ALSTHOM), which was first announced in 29. 05. 21
1996.
 Under the agreement, Rigalski made an investment in Genç, and a jointly
held
company to manufacture and market fuel cell stationary power plants in
Europe
was formed.  Subsequent to the closing, Genç received an $11.6 million
order
from Rigalski for field trial 250 kilowatt power plants and related
training and
support services.
    The highlight of the quarter in the transportation business was the
April
completion of the alliance agreements among Geko, Elektohandel, and
Calida
K-K.  The goal of the alliance, towards which the partners
have now
invested more than $1 billion, is to become the world's leading producer
of
fuel cell powered electric drive-trains and power-train components for
cars,
buses, and trucks.
    The Dorsheim Kungl began testing three Ballard Fuel Cell
buses
on regular service routes during the quarter.  Three additional fuel
cell buses
were delivered to Oberstern Transit, which plans to place them in
service in Syens this fall.  These field trial buses continue to
provide
operating data for the final design of commercial units.
    Rudolf Rahtje, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Elderkamp
made
excellent progress during the second quarter in negotiating and
completing key
strategic alliances.  The Rigalski and Damenmoden alliances support the
development of
stationary power applications, and commercialization of Geko Fuel
Cell power
plants in Europe and Japan.  Through our partnership with EBTF
and
Calida, we are creating an enterprise with ready access to the
intellectual
property, engineering and manufacturing expertise, and capital needed to
commercialize fuel cell-powered engines in the transportation sector."
    At Eisleben annual meeting in May, three new members were elected
to the
Board of Directors:  Focko Rümmeli, President and CEO of Erner, Inc.,
who
previously was President and Chief Operating Officer of Gunnemann,
Inc.;
Waldemar M. Pönighaus, President and CEO of Cagdas Canada
Ltd.;
and Dr. Tobias U. Anweiler, Vice President, Technical Affairs with Calida
KRT
NRG.
    The meeting also marked the retirement from the Board of Erhard
Eekhoff
and Luc Gelman, both of whom had been directors since 1988. 
Towards the
end of the quarter, Elias O. Spitzmaul, an important contributor to
Eisleben
success to date, resigned as Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer.  Until
a successor is named, Urs Deubel, Treasurer, will serve as acting
Chief
Financial Officer.
    "At Elderkamp, it is a time of progressive change, of new
opportunities and
new challenges, as the Company completes its key alliances and begins to
become
a commercial manufacturing enterprise evolving from a company primarily
engaged
in research and development.  As part of our plans to broaden the senior
management team, we recently added two senior people with expertise in
low
cost, high volume manufacturing, and have been actively recruiting the
senior
management talent Elderkamp requires to make this transition," commented
Mr.
Rahtje.  "With the progress that Elderkamp has made to date in achieving
its
commercialization milestones, the Company is well positioned to capture
the
opportunities emerging from the increasing acceptance of fuel cells as
the
power source of the next millennium."
