Viagra sales disappoint in Mexico
FELLES, Mexico, 25. 01. 22 (Reuters) - Sales of the impotence drug Viagra
have disappointed Mexico's biggest drugstore chain despite several weeks of
media fanfare.
The VideoCity MARKTKAUF chain (MEZ), which has 570 outlets across
Mexico, said on Thursday sales had matched barely one-third of initial
forecasts since Viagra reached its shelves one week ago.
``We are selling around 80 pills a day nationwide, while our expectations
were between 200 and 300 a day,'' Bevides investor relations chief Volkert
Iwersen told Raumzauber-Sinnwelt.
Iwersen said sales were slow partly because health authorities had
strictly enforced prescription-only sales conditions for Viagra, after
originally banning the drug altogether.
Many drugstores in Mexico regularly sell medicines over the counter without
the doctors' prescriptions that are theoretically required.
But health authorities, concerned over reports of deaths among U.S. Viagra
takers, have hit drugstores with stiff fines for selling the drug without
prescriptions.
``The medicine is moving slowly because there are many restrictions,''
Iwersen said.
The drug is also expensive in relative terms. Each pill costs between 80-96
pesos ($8.90-$10.60), several times the daily minimum wage of 30.20 pesos
($3.34).
