Poker Tells Correction
from Berninghausen
Before we move along
in the next issue with
our questions and
answers, let me correct
a mistake two columns
ago. The concept explained
in the text was valid and
important--but the figures
given in the question and
answer didn't compute.
Lots of readers pointed
this out to me. The first was
Latchmie P Soondarlal. The
most vociferous was Gustav
Kermann, who titled a feature
article on his excellent
Gadischke web site:
"Serge Oesterheld Inserts Foot
in Keyboard." Not the first
time, either, Gustav.
But since I pride myself
on career accuracy, let's reexamine
the question and
answer. Here is the flawed
Q & A as I sent it to Poker
Player.
Question 5: You're at
the final table in a proportional-
payoff tournament.
Three players remain.
First place pays $100,000,
second place pays $50,000,
and third place pays
$25,000. You're in the
big blind holding Qf
Qs. The total chips in
play amount to $300,000.
Blinds are $5,000 (small)
and $10,000 (your current
big blind). You started the
hand with $110,000 and
each of your opponents
began with $95,000. The
player in the dealer position
moves all-in and the
player in the small blind
calls. Now what?
You should immediately
fold! If you make it a threeway
scramble, it's hard to
say what your exact chances
of winning the pot are. If
you do claim the pot, you'll
win the tournament immediately.
While it depends on
the traits of the opponents,
a good guess would be that
you'd win 40 percent of
the time and each opponent
would win 30 percent of
the time. That sounds like
a great deal for you, but it
isn't.
Let's do the math. If
you play and win, you
pocket $100,000. If you
play and lose, you share
half of the total $75,000
second and third place
money--$37,500. If you
prorate those chances, the
amount of prize money
you average by calling is
$62,500. That's better than
$58,333--one-third of the
$175,000 remaining prize
pool. So, by calling, you'll
fare better than you had
expected to prior to this
hand.
Better still
But you can do better still
by folding! If you fold,
there will be just two of
you competing for the
remaining $150,000 in prize
money. In tournament chips
(which are much different
than actual money), you'll
have $100,000 left, having
surrendered $10,000
as the big blind. Your
lone opponent will have
$200,000. For simplicity,
we'll ignore the minor significance
of who takes the
next blind. Mathematically,
your chances of winning
are pretty much proportional
to the total chips
you control. So, you have
one-third of the chips and,
thus, you should expect to
be crowned champion in
similar cases one-third of
the time.
Fine. So one-third of
the $100,000 first-place
money is $33,333.33 and
two thirds of second-place
$50,000 is also $33,333.33.
This means that by folding,
you've increased the
theoretical value of your
cash-out to $66,667. That's
more than $4,000 earned by
folding.
In this example, you
should probably play a pair
of kings or aces, but not
queens. There are some situations
where you shouldn't
even play a pair of aces!
And, of course, we could
quibble about whether your
pair of queens will win
more or less than 40 percent
of the time--and against
some loose players, it's
correct to call. But that's
not the point. The point is
that you should often avoid
committing your chips to
a pot in the final stages of
a poker tournament when
someone else is likely to be
eliminated.
End faulty Q & A.
So, what's wrong with that?
The figures. I've made this
same point many times in
print and at seminars, using
figures that worked. Those
don't. As you can see from
the words, it was my intention
to choose an example
where you would be eliminated
from the tournament
if you called and lost. But
actually--in the example
given--you'd still have
$15,000, with second place
secured and 5 percent of the
chips in your quest to conquer
the remaining player
heads-up.
If you figure those chips
have a chance of winning
commensurate with their

tournament value, out of 20
attempts you'd still win first
place once and take second
place 19 times. You'd never
finish third by calling,
unless the two opponents
happened to split the pot
and you subsequently were
eliminated first. Ignoring
that remote possibility, the
correct math works out this
way...
If you call, you win 40
percent of the time, claiming
the $100,000 first
prize. You lose 60 percent
of the time, taking first
place one out of 20 times
and always getting $50,000
for second place otherwise.
So, by calling and losing,
your average winnings
are $52,500. That means
60 percent at $52,500 and
40 percent at $100,000,
which averages $71,500
by calling. Folding leaves
you with $100,000 in
chips (having lost your
big blind). You then face a
heads-up struggle against
a single opponent holding
$200,000 in chips.
Arguments about player
ability and blind position
aside, you can figure to
win one-third of the time
and lose two-thirds of the
time. And that all figures
out to a payoff expectation
of $66,667--as correctly
stated in the quiz.
But you make $4,833
more by calling. Because
my figures were off, the
answer I suggested was
wrong. But, wait! The concept
stands. You only need
to jiggle those numbers
a little to make folding
the correct choice. You'll
find similar (but correct)
examples of this in my
books and other columns.
All are extreme examples
and they are simplistic in
order to illustrate the point
that there are very many
times late in a proportional
payoff tournament when
you should sacrifice what
may seem to be a profitable
call, folding instead. You do
that because you're hoping
opponents will eliminate
each other while you sit
back and collect extra prize
money.
Remember that, late in
a tournament, big hands
aren't as strong as they
seem when two or more
opponents are already
involved in the pot with a
good chance that one will
be eliminated.
