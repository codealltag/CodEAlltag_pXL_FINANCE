My questions
answered
For the last two columns,
we've been dealing with
questions and answers
important to poker success.
Today, we move onward
(today's word), further
exploring this method of
teaching--one where I get
to choose the questions that
I answer.
This method works for
me--and I hope it works for
you, too. You see, I just got
tired of being asked questions
by reporters that often
don't pinpoint the issues
and tactics I want to convey.
When that happens, I have
to twist the answers, giving
brief acknowledgment to the
question and then quickly
moving on to what I want to
say. It's a verbal game.
But in this series, I don't
have to bother steering the
answers away from the
questions. My questions are
in complete harmony with
my answers. That makes
me very happy--so let's get
started ...
Question #7: In no-limit
poker, should you usually
bet big on the last round
when you're first to act
and hold an unbeatable
hand?
Often, betting big is a
mistake. In fact, it's a mistake
so costly that even
world-class players cost
themselves a lot of money
annually by overbetting.
Sure, sometimes when
you're against a liberal
caller who's naturally suspicious,
the best decision is to
make a huge bet or to move
all-in.
But against aggressive
opponents or frequent bluff
ers, you should either tease
by making a suspiciously
small wager or simply
check. What you don't want
to do is average only a small
extra profit on these final
rounds of betting. The risk
of not winning anything at
all is enhanced when make
a large wager. Conservative
or cautious opponents will
usually fold.
Tricky and aggressive
opponents will often bet
for you, if you check. Even
if they don't bet--and you
win nothing extra by simply
winning in a showdown--
it's likely that you wouldn't
have gained anything by
betting, either. So, checking
is often the best decision.
Sometimes, it's even better
to make a small wager.
An aggressive player may
respond with a substantial
raise, either with a strong
hand or as a bluff. In either
case, you can then answer
with a large reraise.
Being too aggressive on
the final no-limit betting
round when you act first is
often a mistake. And it can
be a costly one.
Question 8: What governing
law determines the
appropriate bet size in nolimit
poker?
Some players advocate
that you should move allin
whenever you have a
substantial advantage. They
say that the practice makes
no-limit less complex than
limit. While moving all-in
to press your advantage
does, in fact, simplify the
game, it isn't the best way
to structure your betting.
A simple concept is at
work here: When you have
an advantage, try to determine
how large you should
bet to give your opponent
a "fair call." What does
that mean? Well, there's a
mathematical point where
it doesn't matter, from your
opponent's perspective,
whether he calls or not. For
instance, if you bet the size
of the pot against a single
opponent on the final round,
he'll profit by double the
amount he risked by calling
if he wins. That means if
he believes he'll win one in
three times, it doesn't matter
whether he calls or folds.
In the long run, he'll break
exactly even either way. It's
a fair call.
So, in that case, betting
the size of the pot brings
you no gain. But betting less
than that "fair call" amount
provides your opponent
with a bargain. You don't
want to do that, unless your
opponent is the type who
will erroneously fold too
often against a small, teasing
bet. Your goal is to earn
money on all your bets in
the long run, and you do
that by choosing a bet in
accordance with your opponent's
weaknesses.
Up to you
How much more than the
"fair call" amount can you
earn to maximize your
profit? It's up to you to
decide, but you have to
think about how high you
can price your hand against
that specific opponent for
maximum profit. Suppose
your opponent checks on
the final betting round. Now
it's up to you to choose your
bet size. Maybe moving allin
will result in enough calls
to make that the best choice.
Often, a smaller amount will
be right. You'd rather make
more sales at a lower price,
so long as the overall average
profit is greater.
Just remember, when you
have the best hand--and it
warrants a wager--you need
to price it right. That price
must be at least the "fair
call" value, and it should
be more than that if your
opponent can be lured into
calling too much or too
frequently. Pricing a hand
right is the key to profit.
Routinely moving all-in to
protect a hand and simplify
the game isn't correct.

and answers next time.
