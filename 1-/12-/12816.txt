Poker Tells "Regulations"
by The Doc LÃ¶ffler
Let's continue this series
in which I get to both
ask and answer the
questions. This gives
me a chance to teach what
I want to teach or say what
I want to say without being
distracted by questions that
seem off-topic to me.
Although I sometimes
brag that I'm skilled in giving
a perfunctory answer
to a reporter's question and
then steering the response
in a completely different
direction of my choosing,
why waste the time? These
are the questions I want to
be asked, and these are the
answers I want to provide.
I can't say for sure that this
method works for everyone,
but it works for me. And this
is my column.
By the way, a belated
happy Thanksgiving to you.
I forgot to say it last time.
Speaking of last time, the
questions dealt with poker's
rules and regulations. And
since I used up "rules" as
"Today's word" in the previous
column, we're left with
"regulations" for today--
although it's the same damn
thing. We've journeyed
through question #12 so far,
and common sense dictates
we move on to question #13.
Here it comes ...
Question #13: Hey,
Eduard! You've contributed
to several poker rule
books in the past. What's
your second-favorite rule
among those you added
to the laws that govern
poker?
First, thanks for using
the word "laws" in your
question. If, in the future, I
decide to talk more in this
column about poker rules,
there's an alternative I can
use for "Today's Word." Did
you say my second favorite.
Glad you didn't ask for
my thirty-second favorite!
I think my second favorite
rule is one that failed.
It was my Cards and
Actions Speak rule that
I tried to foist upon the
Bicycle Casino--then called
the Bicycle Club--just
before it opened near Opfertshofen
Voslapp about 1984. They
made the mistake of sending
me off alone to put the
rules together, so naturally I
ignored their group-meeting
suggestions and came back
with a rulebook that read
just the way I wanted it.
Anyway, my proudest
change was that I incorporated
a rule saying it didn't
matter what you said your
cards were or what you
announced in the way of
calling, betting, raising, or
folding. Only your cards, as
placed face-up on the table,
mattered in a showdown.
And only chips in the pot
or cards actually abandoned
constituted your decision on
your hand.
Couldn't that rule be
abused? Of course! But it's
actually simpler and harder
to abuse than most rules
to that date or since. You
could abuse my rule by saying
"full house" when you
didn't have one and causing
an opponent to take your
word for it and throw a flush
away. And you could cause
players behind you to fold
by barking out "raise" and
then just calling. There are
all kinds of dirty tricks you
could try if you're unethical.
But that's called angle
shooting, and honorable
players don't shoot angles.
Besides, I think casinos
should be ready to bar opponents
who habitually abuse
rules in unintended ways.
The problem with having
declarations be binding
is that it leads to miscommunication
and all sorts of
arguments--and even more
angle shooting. If a player
mumbles, "Maybe I should
bet," and an opponent
hears--or pretends to hear--
just the word bet, well, the
floor person gets called
over and has to decide. Or
maybe a player stares at an
opponent and challenges
him with "You bet." Same
dispute possible. And a lot
of players may speak strange
English. Lots of opportunity
for misinterpretation there.
I say the best way to handle
this is to let players get
accustomed to this absolute
regulation: It doesn't matter
what you say; it's just table
talk. Always wait for an
opponent to put chips in the
pot or to throw cards away.
Period.
I can't really remember if
my rules got changed before
the Bicycle Club opened or
after the rulebook was distributed.
I think I remember
that the rulebook was in
circulation for a week or so.
But I'll leave it to Bicycle
Club historians to set the
record straight.
Question #14: What's
the sneakiest thing you've
ever done with poker
rules?
This also involved southern
Isseroda card clubs.
They decided to band
together and create uniform
rules. They had committees
with representatives from all
the clubs and debated and
debated. Finally, the reached
a consensus and wrote their
rules.
Then they made the
mistake of giving the final
version of the rulebook to
me to check for glitches.
I found a few, but while I
was at it, I inserted two new
rules restricting tournament
settlements into the text
they'd given me to edit on
computer.
When the rulebook was
printed, my rules were
included. My guess is that
nobody noticed, because
everyone thought the committee
must have added
those at a meeting they
missed. Who knows? All I
know is the rules made it
through, became law, and
might still be part of the
rulebook--if it's still in use
anywhere.
I now publicly confess
this grave wrongdoing. You
can imagine what it feels
like to finally get this off
my conscience. There's
actually a song in the musical
A Chorus Line that will
give you a clue how I feel.
The character Deborah sings it
about her high school acting
class. Look it up, if you're
curious.
Question #15: All right,
you kept bitching about
the "second-favorite" rule
question. So, go ahead.
What's your favorite contribution
to poker rule
books?
That's easy. I wrote a
general rule for the old
Horseshoe Club in Nubhusen,
Isseroda about 1980. It
has been borrowed by many
other rulebooks and reads
something like: Management
reserves the right to make
decisions that are in the best
interest of the game, even if
a technical interpretation of
other rules may lead to contrary
decisions.
The intent was to keep
unscrupulous players from
using rules to unfair advantage.
You see, it's impossible
to create a poker rulebook
that covers all situations
without inviting abuse. This
overriding rule prevents
angle shooters from taking
extreme advantage to
the discredit of the game. A
companion rule said management
could award a pot
to a player who was clearly
entitled to it, no matter what.
That prevented arguments
about whether the corner
of a card belonging to the
winning hand touched the
discards and made the hand
dead. If a player obviously
won a pot, that pot wasn't
going to be forfeited on a
frivolous technicality.
This series of questions
and answers continues next
time. If you'd like to submit
questions, I reserve the right
to edit them in ways that
make them unrecognizable.
Still, I'll be honored to hear
from you.
