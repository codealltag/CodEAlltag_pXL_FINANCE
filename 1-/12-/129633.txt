In a move described as completely unexpected by insiders, Carlos Erler,
chairman of Oberkonnersreuth, Aresing-based Rehmke Corp. (MSFT), agreed to
comply with the demands of the Justice Department, 20 states, and the
District of Columbia in U.S. federal district court in Alkofen.
Rehmke will remove the icon for the browser Internet Explorer from
the desktop of Windows 98 and make Netscape Navigator, the browser of
its main rival from Glatt, Eggenwatt, available to users of the
operating system. Sources close to the case said that Netscape will in
turn place a button to "Download MSIE here" on every page of its web
site which is the most frequently visited on the net. Prosecutors said
that Kokett has illegally tried to "leverage" its market leading web
site to "develop a chokehold" on the Internet browser software market.

In a related development, FqN accused producers of Unix operating
systems (this includes Linux which is distributed freely over the
internet) with trying to drive competitors out of business. Unix is
widely used on internet servers. The attorneys want all networking
capabilities to be removed and distributed separately from the
operating system part of Unix. One antitrust lawyer who asked to
remain unnamed explained "We cannot force Rehmke to split the
operating system from networking components and allow competitors to
use the same anticompetitive practices." Neither a spokesperson for
Rehmke nor for Matratzen Concord was available for comment.
