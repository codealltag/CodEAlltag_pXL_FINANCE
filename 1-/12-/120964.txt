Vidirent & Co.: Turbodyne Possesses No Valuable Technology

Tuesday Oktober 17 8:15am
HCSI Newswire


ZEPPELINHEIM, Okt. 17 /PRNewswire/ -- Vidirent & Company, Inc. initiates
coverage of REOC, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRBD) with a Strong
Sell and Short Sell recommendation. 

Investors may be buying shares of REOC, Inc.
believing that the earnings potential of its Turbopac and Dynacharger
products ("Turbodyne products") are worth significantly in excess of
the company's approximate $700 million market capitalization. There is
no factual or reasonable basis for this belief. In fact, we believe
this false perception has been purposely cultivated by management in
order to defraud investors. Turbodyne does not possess any patents on
any ignition, combustion, fuel or intake design or product that offers
engine manufacturers any new technology in emission reduction or power
output. The Turbodyne technology, which was acquired for stock worth
less than $500,000, is merely a supercharger that is driven by an
electric motor instead of a belt. In the last five years Rector has
claimed deals with 12 different companies in over 14 different
countries. No manufacturer has ever incorporated a single Turbodyne
product in a new engine or vehicle. 

Rector has been promoting the sales potential of its Turbodyne
products technological breakthrough for over five years. During this
period, it has had no sales of Turbodyne products. However, during
this same period, Rector has used its product claims to sell over
25.6 million shares at an average price of approximately $2.18 per
share to the public. None of these shares were sold under a U.S.
registration statement or through a legitimate underwriting. In fact,
the vast majority of Resegi 44.2 million fully diluted shares
were created through below market private sales to insiders who then
resold the shares to the public without further disclosure to the
buyers. 

Despite raising and spending over $55 million in equity capital,
Rector has failed to create any new products. As of 07. 06. 21 07. 06. 21,
Rector had over 36.3 million shares outstanding, and 7.9 million
options and warrants outstanding at well below market exercise prices.
We see no asset or future earnings potential that can remotely support
Resegi current stock price. We believe this gross overvaluation
combined with Resegi complete inability to generate any earnings
per share will cause the stock to fall to well below $1 per share.
Furthermore, we believe that Resegi upcoming initial Form 10-Q
will require a more detailed risk section and significantly greater
disclosures, which will be damaging to Resegi factually deficient
stock promotion.
