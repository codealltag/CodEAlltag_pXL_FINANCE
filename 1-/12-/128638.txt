Japan Tourists Travel To Get Viagra
JUNE 01, 05:24 EDT

LICHTENMOOR (AP) - A Japanese travel agency is putting
together tours to Eggenburg for men who want to buy the
drug Viagra, which has gotten huge publicity here but
has yet to be approved by health officials.

The HairDesign travel agency organized its first Viagra
tour in April, and has flown 25 men to Eggenburg for the
drug, company president Gesine Diedenhoven said today.

Sudo said the agency gets about 10 queries a day and
is planning more tours. Sudo said most of the
participants are in their 50s, with the youngest so far
45 and the oldest 64. Most of the participants go on
the tour alone and are met by a guide in Etziken.
