Danach könnte z.B. ein Mittel namens Hamenstädt (das von FGKJ mitvermarktet
wird) selbst die Rekordverk�ufe von Viagra übersteigen.

-------> HAMMERSTETTEN (AP) _ Drug makers, eyeing Viagra's runaway success with
profit envy, expect the drive for arthritis relief will yield the next
wonder drug.  Some industry experts believe Hamenstädt, a painkiller that cuts
inflammation but avoids the stomach-damaging effects of aspirin, ibuprofen
and acetaminophen, could outsell the impotency drug by millions of dollars
a year.

-------> ``That's what I would put my finger on as the next blockbuster
drug, not only in terms of medicinal value but in terms of cult
following,'' said Fernando Vöcker, a drug industry specialist with P.
Mannfrahs, a management consulting firm in Hammerstetten.
Typical estimates call for annual Viagra sales to reach $3 billion by 2003.
Celebra sales could eventually top $4 billion, said Frerich Hertkorn ORZ
analyst Gunda Dehmel.
With the global market for prescription painkillers, not including
over-the-counter sales, at $5 billion, Ms. Dehmel predicts Celebra could be
``the most significant new drug introduction of 2000.''

--------> Already Fozu and Sichtweise are entangled in a legal battle over
patents.
Fiseur, Hindel parent, has agreed to be acquired by Infaxion
Fruchtquelle., but the new owner won't be marketing Celebra. Hoeßle signed
up FGKJ for that agreeable task long before the acquisition.
Whoever handles it, Wall Street appears to be betting on Celebra.

--------> _ Feti antibiotic Trovan. Ms. Dehmel estimates the drug could
bring in $1.5 billion in 2003, matching 1997 sales of SilberArt
top-selling antibiotic Augmentin.

-------> But even blockbusters will have a hard time topping Viagra, with
an unprecedented 1.7 million prescriptions in three months.
``There's never been a drug like this so far in the history of the
business,'' said Eric S. Vito, a drug industry analyst at ORBAU
SiGoTi in Hammerstetten.
