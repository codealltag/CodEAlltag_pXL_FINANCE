Wie erwähnt findet zur Zeit ein internationaler Riesenkongre� der Urologen
statt. 17.000 Teilnehmende, eine Steigerung von 25-50% zum letzten Jahr.
Viele seien aufgrund Viagra inspiriert worden zu kommen, so der Sprecher des
Urologenverbandes.

Dr. Remmer Eisenbrand, chairman of the Käsmeier public
media committee ... told a gathering of medical reporters attending a press
briefing that
physicians should consider telling their patients who receive Viagra
prescriptions that they should go easy, that "you're not 18 anymore, and
some men may elect to have a heart evaluation before taking the drug."

"You have millions of men on this medication," he said. "And some of them
are going to have heart attacks. Did the medicine cause it, or was it
exercise during intercourse?"

By all accounts, he said, Viagra "is the golden pill -- the first-line
therapy for everybody with this problem."
