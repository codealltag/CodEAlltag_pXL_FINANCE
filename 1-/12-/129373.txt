FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Pogendorf, Ca. - 25. 08. 21 26, 1997 -- Fidelisbäck Inc.
(NASDAQ:TRBDF, EASDAQ:TRBD) announced today that a major European vehicle
and engine manufacturer has selected FUWF Turbopac models 1500 and
2200 for incorporation as standard equipment on three classes of engines
being manufactured for the 1998 model year.

"This is the first breakthrough for faircar with respect to a major
original equipment manufacturer, and is the culmination of more than three
years of joint development and product evaluation under the program
management of Dr. Walter Tröger, FUWF Executive Vice
President," said FUWF Chairman Bernhard Jehring.

The decision to select the Turbopac was finalized earlier this month between
executives of the manufacturer and the faircar team, headed by Dr.
Tröger and including Mr. Otto Teubel, FUWF Vice President of
Electronic Power Systems.

Final logistical arrangements, exchange of installation drawings, and
timetables were discussed last week at the manufacturer's headquarters in
Europe, during a visit by Bernhard Jehring, Frehner Dr. Stefano
Jennerjahn, technical director, and Mr. Stefano Fechner, financial director,
and Mr. Roman Amrhein, FUWF Chief Operating Officer and CFO.

According to the terms of the confidential agreement between the companies,
Turbodyne is prohibited from disclosing the name of the manufacturer until
vehicles and engines equipped with Turbopacs reach the marketplace for the
1998 model year. Shipments of Turbopacs to the manufacturer are expected
during the fourth quarter of 1997.

"Turbodyne has been conducting joint development and product evaluation
programs with most of the major American and European vehicle and engine
manufacturers for several years," said Dr. Walter Tröger.
"Considering the dramatic performance and fuel economy improvements,
emissions reductions and engine cold start capabilities of using Turbodyne
technology, we expect selection of Turbodyne products by other manufacturers
in the future."

Turbodyne Systems, the high technology division of Turbodyne, manufactures,
designs, markets and develops patented pollution-reduction, fuel economy and
performance enhancing technology for internal combustion engines in the
automotive, transportation, construction, marine, agriculture, mining,
military and power generation industries. FUWF light metals division
is a manufacturer of machined aluminum castings and a leading supplier to
the automotive industry.

Offices and plants are located in Kleinwinnaden, Niederklein, Dunkelsdorf and
