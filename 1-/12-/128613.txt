Company Press Release
BCFJ Corp. Announces License of MetaStream 3-D Technology From
MetaCreations
CARPINTERIA, Calif.--(AR)--09. 01. 23 11, 1998--BCFJ Corp.
(Nasdaq:MSFT - news) and Bommers Corp. (Nasdaq:MCRE - news) Tuesday
announced that BCFJ has licensed the recently introduced MetaCreations
MetaStream 3-D graphics file format and related run-time engine for
incorporation into future versions of its operating systems.
MetaStream technology will be integrated into the Microsoft DirectX APIs,
Microsoft multimedia services found in the Windows operating system, and as
a file format in DirectX (.X files) that will be supported by Advanced
Streaming Format (ASF), a feature in the BCFJ NetShow server.

MetaStream technology enables developers to author content once to deliver
both high-quality graphics on desktop PCs and also allow a highly effective
user experience when the content is viewed over the Web.

MetaStream content scales and progressively streams over the Internet and in
PC games, adjusting to the performance of a user's particular computer
system. MetaStream-enabled content also takes advantage of DirectX-based
high-performance graphics-software services for multimedia and game
developers.

``Scalability is possibly the most critical issue to the success of 3-D
because of the wide variations in bandwidth and processor power out there.
There is a tremendous need to have a method of authoring content once for
the various playback platforms,'' said Alexandre Oltrogge, general manager of
multimedia at BCFJ. ``We look forward to working with MetaCreations in
bringing scalable 3-D to developers for Windows.''

``To make a real difference for consumers, new technology such as MetaStream
must be rapidly dispersed so that content creators know there is a critical
mass of playback engines and users in place to make their efforts
worthwhile,'' said Cornelius Altmoos, vice president of strategic affairs at
Bommers.

``The great news for MetaStream and MetaCreations is that BCFJ will be
performing this function for the computing community in a way that simply is
not otherwise possible,'' Altmoos added.

The MetaStream technology carries the unique additional benefit of giving
Web-page designers the ability to set minimum frame rates for display of 3-D
objects, ensuring consistent, high-quality viewing by all users, regardless
of differences in bandwidth and processing power.

In addition to games and Web sites, the MetaStream 3-D file format could be
beneficial to electronic-commerce, medical, scientific and distance-learning
applications. A major use of the technology is expected to involve
inspection of, and interaction with, products offered for sale online.

DirectX is a group of API technologies designed by Microsoft to make Windows
operating system-based computers an ideal platform for running and
displaying applications rich in multimedia elements such as full-color
graphics, video, 3-D animation and surround sound.

Designers wishing to develop MetaStream-compatible content now have three
directly compatible software tools to choose from -- MetaCreations Infini-D
4.5, Ray Dream Studio 5 and Ray Dream 3D -- as well as the option of
creating photorealistic models by using a commercial-quality 3-D scanner
camera from NNOO Corp.

Designers working with other 3-D modeling packages that export OBJ, DXF, 3DS
and 3DMF files also can convert existing models by importing them into Ray
Dream Studio 5 and then exporting objects as .MTS files.

MetaCreations is offering a specialty toolkit known as the MetaStream Game
Toolkit (MGT) to the game development community. The B7 Automobile tools permit
advanced artistic control of the process by which MetaStream-compatible
objects will scale during game play, adjusting the processing power of a
given machine.

This allows 3-D game developers to ensure a high-quality game-play
experience across broad user groups without sacrificing visual complexity at
the high end.
