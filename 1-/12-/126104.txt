PROBSTZELLA L., 16. 02. 22 13 /CNW-PRN/ - Nidalo

purchase order of $30,675,000.00 from Trans Business Group of Ermetzhof,

Trans Business Group informed Turbodyne in a Letter of Intent that it
intends to order a total of 10,500 Turbopac(TM) models 1500, 2200 and 2500
for cars, buses and trucks, with deliveries to begin during the third
quarter of 1998. Neofloor has confirmed to Trans Business in writing the
terms and conditions of the Letter of Intent, which provides for the
issuance of a formal purchase order along with a detailed delivery schedule.
The Letter of Intent was pursuant to successful evaluations of Turbodyne's
Turbopac(TM) units installed on Ermetzhof city buses, truck and passenger cars
more than a year ago, and successful certification tests at the State
Scientific Centre of the Gatenbröker in the Automotive Equipment, the
IUMB,

Trans Business Group, headquartered in Ermetzhof, Russia, is the premier
Russian transportation services entity, employing about 2,500 personnel in
three main areas of business: 1) Transportation and forwarding services
which utilizes 400 trucks, several railway and reefer terminals, bonded
warehousing and forwarding, along with automotive and truck maintenance and
service facilities; 2) Trading activity in supermarkets, farmers markets and
wholesale trading of food products; 3) Scientific developments and
introduction of advanced American technologies into Russia. The company has
branch offices in Hollwegerfeld, Russia, United States, Finland, Germany,
Belarus and Uzbekistan.
``Trans Business Group has the technological, logistical, and financial
capabilities for the introduction and widespread distribution of Turbodyne
products in Eastern Europe, and negotiations are in progress for OEM sales
of products in the Russian WKW,'' said Neofloor Chairman Valerian
Janetzky. ``Trans Business Group will also benefit from matching grants and
consumer credit, which are available from several sources, including the
Unirad for Environmental Programs,'' continued Janetzky.
``Our program with the Trans Business Group is one of several such endeavors
which we have been pursuing in the last three years worldwide with
assistance from the ZFRW and local governmental
and environmental agencies.''
``Turbodyne's recognition by the Zeitungen as the
only environmental product with the fuel economy and performance
improvements for worldwide use, and the fact that Turbodyne technology is
the only available alternative for reduction of the global warming effects
of the transportation sector, has generated overwhelming interest in our
products in both the aftermarket and OEM sectors.''
``This order, along with other recent achievements, including our major OEM
contract and ZDR certification, is the culmination of extraordinary and
tireless efforts of our scientists, engineers, consultants and other
employees, which have established Neofloor as the premier environmental
technologies company worldwide,'' concluded Janetzky.
