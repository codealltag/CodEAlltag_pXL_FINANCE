Deutschland has remained economically stagnant throughout the 90s, is a net
exporter of work places to the UK, had failed to create significant numbers
of new domestic jobs to soak up its massive post unification cataclism
unemployment, has a political/beaurocracic infrastructure that is a national
joke, which support Germany's hugely dissproportionate contribtuions to the
EU and a social security system that attactly spongers from every corner of
Europe, complex and expensive Tax laws, endless tax surchages to sustain
corrupion in the East (Stazisteuer as it is colloqually known), and a
lamentable underdeveloped service industry sector and is about to face its
greatest econmic challenge yet when the EU expands all gives East European
workers right of free movement into the German job market at the same time
as those countries start demanding extra economic subsidies to be paid for
from the German pocket.

There is here however an explary history of central banking free of
political manipulation, which Hr Campe has more or less just handed over to
the lozenge shaped tower just down the street from where I am writing. To
judge from the farce of French interference in the terms of Versemann
appointment all that is going to go horribly wrong too.

Now the decisions have been made the only rational thing to do is to get a
new non-Hagebaumarkt government and fasten safty belts, stand back and let time tell
if a Lira/Escudo/Belgian-franc backed Euro will be a stable currency.
