Poker Tells "Elimination"
Author Schwaaf
In poker, there are
some misconceptions
that are
widely accepted
as gospel. For instance,
many serious players, even
professionals, believe that
cards come in unexplainable
streaks - hot and cold.
When you're on a hot steak,
they think, your fortunes
are more likely to be favorable
on the following hand.
And when you're on a cold
streak, you should expect
bad fortune to continue.
So, when they're experiencing
a good run, they
take more chances and play
more aggressively. When
they're experiencing a bad
run, they play fewer hands.
That actually turns out
to be a good tactic, but not
for the reason they assume.
You can, indeed, profit by
playing more hands, more
aggressively, when you're
getting good cards. But
it has nothing to do with
streaks or superstition. It
has to do with the likelihood
that your opponents
will be more intimidated by
you when they notice that
you've been winning. In
that state, they're less likely
to take full advantage of
their own good cards. And
that means you can make
extra profit by pushing
yours for maximum value
without fearing retaliation.
So, let's call that a harmless
misconception. There
are, unfortunately, poker
misconceptions shared
by both novice and experienced
players that are
costly. Today I'm going to
talk about one that has to
do with tournaments. Let's
revisit a lecture I gave over
a decade ago. Here's the
transcript...
A poker tournament
misconception
Even among professional
poker tournament players
- those who make the
rounds from casino to casino
across the world - playing
in 300 or more events
each year, you'll hear an
often-repeated tournament
concept that's absolutely
screwy!
The bad advice is: You
must always seek to eliminate
players in a percentage-
payoff tournament.
Wanna know the truth? The
truth is, unless you have a
significant advantage, you
should seldom go out of
your way to eliminate players
early in a tournament.
Even if you have mountains
of chips and your opponent
has only a few, it is
not your job to force an
opponent all-in in hopes of
eliminating him.
But this notion is so
entrenched among some
tournament players that
they even swear that you're
required to make a "cour

tesy" call when you have
a large stack and your
opponent puts himself allin
for a small amount of
chips. In truth, the later it
is in the tournament, the
more beneficial it is for
you to do this - within
reason. But, early in a
tournament with, say,
201 players remaining,
there is very little value
in taking even slightly the
worst of it to knock an
opponent out of the competition.
That's the truth,
and now I'll tell you why
their common advice to
the contrary is bad...
Veering off course
When you're thinking
about veering off course to
knock an opponent out of
the tournament, you need
to ask yourself this question:
How much will this
sacrifice cost me? Let's say
it will only cost $12 in tournament
chips to try. Then
ask yourself how much you
will gain from eliminating
an opponent. Wait! This
is tricky. If there are 201
players left, you will actually
gain, on average, about
1/200th of the value. That's

because the value of eliminating
this one opponent is
divided among the entire
field of remaining players.
In other words, whatever
value eliminating this player
adds to the expectations
of all players, you -- being
only one of 200 players
-- will profit only the same
as the others will. So, if
it's costing you $12 to try
and you're taking $5 the
worst of it, then the value
of eliminating this player
right now needs to be at
least $1,000 (200 players
times $5). Otherwise, you
usually shouldn't go out of
your way to eliminate that
player. We're talking about
tournament chip money
here. You might be a little
more aggressive in trying
to eliminate a strong opponent,
but not by much.
Now it becomes clear
why the advice to always
try to eliminate opponents
is terrible. Most players
sacrifice too much in
their attempt to eliminate
opponents. The logic I've
just presented is not pure,
though. Who benefits most
by the elimination of an
opponent depends on the
size of players' stacks. Not
everyone benefits equally,
so I just used a crude
example to show that the
average benefit is shared
among all players. By the
way, it is not always clear
who benefits more by the
elimination of an opponent
-- a player with a large
stack or the player with
a small stack. At the last
table, small stacks clearly
benefit more, because they
move up in money position
when they might otherwise
have been eliminated. In
early stages, players with
large stacks sometimes
benefit more when a
short stack tries to do the
eliminating, because mathematically
their stacks are
chip-for-chip less valuable
than stacks of opponents
with fewer chips.
This is clear: One of the
best things that can happen
to all remaining players
is for two opponents with
huge stacks to collide and
one be eliminated. You
then face the same number
of opposing chips, but you
have fewer opponents to
contend with and the chips
become reduced in value,
because they're concentrated
in a single stack.
Contrary to the opinions
of some, this concentration
of chips does not make it
harder for you to win a
tournament. If everyone
were playing primarily
to win first place, your
chances of winning first
place are about the same
with your $10,000 versus
two opponents, each with
$45,000, as your same
$10,000 versus one player
with $90,000.
Guaranteed
In each case -- ignoring
other minor factors
-- your chance of winning
are about 10 percent.
That's because in both
cases, you control 10 percent
of the chips and 90
percent are controlled by
others. Ignoring the allin
factor, that makes it
about 9-to-1 against you,
no matter how you apportion
the chips among your
opponents. Of course, your
chance of taking second
are much greater against
the single opponent. In
fact, your chances of taking
at least second are
guaranteed -- and that's
why you want big stacks
to go to war, especially
late in a tournament, so
they eliminate each other,
giving you a bigger payday
without even playing
a hand. It's also why
-- when you have a lot of
chips -- you do not want
to go to war at high risk
against another big stack.
That's just gives the idle
players an advantage.
The big argument players
give for wanting to
eliminate an opponent is:
"They might come back
to beat you." So what?
They might come back to
beat somebody else, too.
Besides, they're more likely
to beat you if you try to
eliminate them and lose,
because then they have
more chips to build from
and to beat you with. Why
is it so much more tragic
if a person you might have
eliminated comes back to
beat you than if someone
else knocks you out of a
tournament? There is no
logic to this common wisdom.
Think about it.
The only thing that
matters is whether sacrificing
normally profitable
strategy in an effort
to eliminate an opponent
will add or subtract from
your expected payoff. In
the late stages of a tournament,
where you share the
benefit with fewer players
when an opponent is
eliminated, it's often worth
making a moderate sacrifice.
In the early stages, it
is not. That's the simple
truth. You may not like
the sound of it, and it may
run contrary to everything
you've heard before. But
it's the truth, anywa
