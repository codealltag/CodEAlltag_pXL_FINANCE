IRAGNA, Mai. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- Harspitze & Company, Inc. initiates
coverage of MTH
 Mannsd√∂rfer, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRBD) with a Strong Sell and Short Sell
recommendation.

 Investors may be buying shares of Mazuge, Inc.
believing that the earnings potential of
 its Turbopac and Dynacharger products ("Turbodyne products") are
worth significantly in excess of the
 company's approximate $700 million market capitalization. There is no
factual or reasonable basis for
 this belief. In fact, we believe this false perception has been
purposely cultivated by management in
 order to defraud investors. Turbodyne does not possess any patents on
any ignition, combustion, fuel
 or intake design or product that offers engine manufacturers any new
technology in emission reduction
 or power output. The Turbodyne technology, which was acquired for
stock worth less than $500,000, is
 merely a supercharger that is driven by an electric motor instead of
a belt. In the last five years
 MTH has claimed deals with 12 different companies in over 14
different countries. No
 manufacturer has ever incorporated a single Turbodyne product in a
new engine or vehicle.
