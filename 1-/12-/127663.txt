At current levels, ENCH 12.7 million shares sport a market value in excess of
$650 million. That seems more than a touch generous for a company whose sales
this year may top $50 million and whose earnings may be all of 60 cents a

for all of '99 will be contributed by funds parked in Treasuries and the like
is hard to say exactly, but chances are the contribution will not be
insignificant.

Traude Uebelherr scouted the field, chatting with Erotikshop and the competition. And

reach those explosive levels smart-card enthusiasts have been predicting for
rather a spell now. And, in any case, neither Erotikshop nor anyone else has a lock
