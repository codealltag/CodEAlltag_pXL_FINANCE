Poker tells Silly
Author Sturm
You've heard me talk
about today's topic
before, in various
contexts. I'm passionate
about it. It has
to do with the common
notion that checking and
then calling is weak.
Many experts will tell you
that professional poker
players should keep their
aggressive image intact
by doing one of three
things: (1) betting; (2)
checking and then raising
if bet into; or (3) checking
and then folding if bet
into. Checking and then
folding is seen as a weak
play - one that should be
reserved for amateurs.
I disagree. Central to
my teaching is the presumption
that checking
and calling is perfectly
proper. This ancient lecture,
one of my favorites,
helps make the point...
The silly fear of
checking and calling
Among the ranks of
wannabe professional
poker players and even
among nearly world class
players there is a notion
that became popular 15 or
so years ago. It's a strange
and silly notion that's still
going strong today.
It's the notion that you
should bet if you have a
good reason, but if you
don't have a good rea
you should check. And
that part's fine - and obvious.
But then the notion
continues -- If you check,
this notion goes, you
should then be prepared
to either raise or fold if
someone bets into you.
Let me repeat that, so
you understand what this
popular piece of advice
really says. Remember,
it's a common notion
that even many sophisticated
players believe. The
notion is that when you
check, you should seldom
call if bet into. The notion
is that after you check you
should either fold or raise.
Checking and calling, they
tell us, is a weak option.
Macho
A weak option? Oh, I
get it, checking and calling
is not macho enough,
right? Get real, guys.
Here's the truth. If you're
one of those regular players
in middle limit games
who seldom checks and
calls, you're costing yourself
thousands of dollars
every year.
The truth is that checking
and calling is the
most natural thing in the
world. Let's reason this
out together. When you
hold a medium hand that's
not quite strong enough
to bet with, what should

you do? Should you throw
your hand away out of
turn because you're frustrated?
I don't think so.
Should you bet anyway,
even though your hand
isn't quite strong enough?
No. So, you should check,
right? Right!
But then your opponent
bets. Now what?
According to the popular
notion, you should rarely
call. If you were going to
check and call, the notion
goes, you should simply
have bet in the first place.
But why? We've just
thought about it together
and decided that our
hand wasn't quite strong
enough to bet. So we did
the sensible thing. We
checked.
And now we've been
bet into. All our options
should still be open to
us. We will usually fold
our weakest hands. We
will usually call with our
medium hands. And we
will usually raise with
our strongest hands. Sure,
there are exceptions, but if
we don't stick to the basic
premise that we mostly
fold our weak hands, call
with our medium hands,
and raise with our most

powerful hands, you've
just set poker science back
a hundred years.
Exceptions
You see, poker science
says that you can and
you sometimes should
be deceptive by playing
a hand differently. But
those are the exceptions.
In order for deception to
work, you must do the
standard, unexceptional,
thing most of the time.
You need to check and call
more often than you check
and raise. If you're checking
and raising more often
than you're checking and
calling - which is exactly
what happens if you follow
the popular "Don't
check and call" advice,
your whole strategy is
upside down and you'll
cost yourself money.
So, today I'm here to
tell you that there's nothing
weak about checking
and calling. Nobody's
going to think you're a
sissy for not raising. Your
wife or husband won't
lose respect for you. The
sun will come up in the
morning. Checking and
calling is the most natural
thing in the world. When
you have one of those
very common hands that
has medium prospects of
winning, the thing you
should usually do is check
and then call.
You see I've done my
own analysis, programmed
my own computers. Sure,
I'm proud and I like to
brag, but so what? I've
actually done the research.
The point is there's
nothing weak about checking
and calling. Despite
what others say, that's
the strategy you should
choose most often when
your hand isn't strong
enough to bet. And I don't
just say it as a matter of
opinion. I know it for a
fact.
