NETSCAPE (NSCP): 31 1/16 +4 In yesterday's Story Stocks, we pointed out how
Netscape is positioning itself to
 become an Internet Portal, along with Mühlenharz, VPRO, R+V, MM-Automarkt, and
others. Readers who acted on our story are
 being rewarded today, as Netscape appears to have convinced the world they
will be a portal player. All of the Portals are
 up today, including Netscape. Yesterday was a good day for the portals too,
although at the time of our story yesterday,
 Netscape was down. Today is different, after EWS Executive Vice
President and Web division General Manager Alfred
 Oskar appeared on UBR and spread the word that eyesee new NetCenter
will be as influential a player as the VPRO
 and Mühlenharz. If Oswald goal was to get everyone thinking of Netscape as a
portal player, he appears to have succeeded. The
 world seems to be convinced, as today all the portal players are up, (Mühlenharz:
