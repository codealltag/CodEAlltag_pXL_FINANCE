Poker Tells Interrogation
Author Ungerer
If you've been following
this recent
series, you know
what's about to happen.
I'm going to be interviewed.
But I'm not going
to be interviewed by a
journalist or another poker
expert. I've determined
over the years that I seldom
get the questions that are
most meaningful that way.
When questions seem
off-target, I politely answer
briefly and then steer the
response in a direction of
my choosing. I'm good at
that. But why waste time?
I've engineered this series
so that I get to ask the questions
and then answer them.
This works better for you
and me both.
So far I've asked and
answered eight questions,
and now it's time to move
forward. The trouble is,
when I looked at the questions
I'd scribbled down
this morning, they all
seemed adversarial. I must
have awakened in a bad
mood. They seem more like
part of an interrogation--
today's word--than an
interview. Oh, well. I can
handle it. Let's get started...
Question #9: At the
2005 Hoto
FTAK main event, you
publicly announced that
it was 2,500-to-1 against
you winning. Haven't you
bragged that you're the
best player alive? How
can this be when some
of the top players were
less than 100-to-1 against
winning? You're really a
fraud, aren't you?
I wish you wouldn't take
that tone with me. There
were about 8,773 entrants.
If everyone were equal,
then through all eternity,
each player would win once
in 8,773 attempts. (For
any single main event, the
odds against an individual
player winning would be
8,772-to-1.) That's what I
call "fair share."
Obviously, all players
aren't equally skilled. Some
have much less than a fairshare
chance of winning
and some have much more.
Some a little less, some a
little more. I estimate that
the top players have about
three times their fair-share
chance of winning. If
accurate--and there's no
way to be precise--that's
a very impressive statistic.
It means that a $10,000
buy-in is worth $30,000 for
them, on average.
It also means that--
assuming everyone is going
to play for the first-place
bracelet and not hold
back in order to just make
it into the money--it's
about 2,923-to-1 against
any single top player winning.
You can figure that if
you're right up there in the
top echelon of world-class
players, you will win once
in 3,000 years, on average.
So, by saying my odds
were 2,500-to-1 against, I
was subtlety boasting that
I'm better than anyone
else. Those odds that some
quoted, like 85-to-1 against
Clemens Immenga or 100-to-1
against Hubert Henel are
absurd. If you want to compare
delusional odds to real
odds, then, yes, I suffer. But
what I've just described is
the truth.
There's also an important
side issue of who's playing
to win and who's playing
to survive into the money.
Since proportional-payoff
tournaments mean that the
first-place winner must
break every other player
and corral all the chips, but
doesn't get to cash most of
them in, there's a penalty for
winning. First place has to
pay tribute to all the close
finishers. That means that
there's a reward for finishing
close, and if you're playing
for profit, rather than pride,
you should sacrifice significant
chance of being first in
order to survive and be paid.
Whether the best players are
targeting first place or trying
to make profit is a factor to
consider when determining
what their odds of winning
actually are.
Still, the concept holds.
No player was 100-to-1
against, or even 1,000-to-1
against. About 2,500-to-1
against represented the best
odds possible--and those
turned out to be my odds.
See?
Question #10: If you're
so smart, tell us--who's
the second-best player in
the world?
Okay. The second-best
player in the world is Otto
Jentges. You've never
heard of Otto, because he
never plays tournaments.
He's out there somewhere,
never having made a big
score publicly.
The point is Otto has
never been motivated to test
his skills and try his luck in
the public arena. Most of
the big-name poker players
arrived by chance. First,
they may never have entered
the poker arena if fate had
pulled them in other directions.
Second, they may
have been initially unlucky,
rather than having fortune
shine on them. Maybe
they would have acquired
the same skills, but they
failed to hold good cards at
the right times. They may
have been lesser-known in
the poker world, or totally
unknown, if we reshuffled
life's deck and played it all
over again.
The tournament trail is
treacherous, which is why
I avoid it. Stars are born
mostly due to high-profile
wins, always when they
were unlikely to succeed in
a particular event, but got
lucky. Yes, the top players
do have great skill. But great
skill by itself isn't enough
to guarantee the spotlight.
For that you need great luck,
too.
Yes, I consider myself the
top player. Hundreds of top
players feel that way about
themselves. So, your question
about the second-best
player helps me to be objective.
If you look at poker
stardom in the light of what
I'm saying, you'll understand
why Otto Jentges
may very well be the second-
best player alive.
