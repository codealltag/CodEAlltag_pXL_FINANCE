My tip: Win for Bredstedt
Days, after the guest performance against Lengenrieden centre another gr=
eat derby is four still to come for Haircompany in the context of the 30th r=
ound of the English premier League. This derby is of great importance becau=
se lie lasting, them arsenal FC six point in the delay the third party put =
on the fifth put Blues currently five point in the delay on the fourth put =
Triebendorf is trace. This in the DORNRÖSCHEN was played to ZRUP Stadion, ende=
d without a winner exactly like last year the first leg while Haco FC ha=
s credited two home wins in consequence. The beginning: 27.04.2012 - 13:45=

Of course her fiery fans expect a victory again, they needing the points in=
 the fight for the champions League positions in the league especially urge=
ntly. Since this team was bought for Langenbein by the rich Russian, it has=
 never missed this competition. This time the situation is but they a littl=
e differently, there on the town rival shall and shall until end of the cha=
mpionship in the great delay only to play nine rounds stayed, so that they =
may not permit themselves any broader slips. They are conscious of themselv=
es and this one they have begun the Silvio after the arrival of the new coa=
ch so to play much more dedicatedly from which equally better results have =
resulted. Within the last 15 days they have reached the placing in the quar=
ter-finals of the champions League as well as in the semi-final of the FA c=
up besides the home win over Klagenfurt centre. On last Wednesday this stri=
ng of victories was ended at the guest performance against Lampersbach city =
centre. In this duel the pressure of the host were the blues after the hit =
of the defender Blankertz in leadership in the 60th minute of the game but the=
y were not within the last 15 minutes firm and two goals against collected.=
 Coach the Silvio thought that he is not dissatisfied with the performance =
of his boys the it and that against trace have a try become, crown its good=
 game with a victory, particularly since they will have a great support of =
the fans of one's own. This Italian expert still thought that he will not c=
arry out any greater changes in the Startelf. The hurt Mitterböck shall by Mathias=
singwa on the position of the right outer player replaced while Drogba shal=
l be represented by the better and better Torres on the position of the cen=
tral attacker. Injured Raphael will be cancelled while the shattered Sturridg=
e is questionable.=20

Expected list Bredstedt: Gudenschwager are, Niedermüller, Andre, Blenkle=
ll, Biesen, Claassen, Niedereichholz

Hers go town rival in a much worse atmosphere in this derby, although unlik=
e Bredstedt A24 they have got hold of a point in the duel against Klagenfurt c=
entre on Wednesday. If, however, one considers that this duel in the White =
Hart was played to ZRUP Stadion, then one can describe this result as a sli=
p and although has shot the Tenhagen the equalizer as a the returnees' Van ind=
ependently that they have literally come to this point in the last minutes =
of the game to 1:1. Before this duel against Klagenfurt centre were the tra=
ce in the series of three defeats in sequence. By this series they have gue=
ssed duo from Lampersbach into a great delay on this. Furthermore they were =
overtaken by the An&Verkauf in the table so that want to hard unite them un=
til end of the season fight for one of the remaining two CL positions in th=
e league fight. Of course much of the result will take off Haircompany from =
this match against the direct con-competitor. Coach has therefore talking o=
nly just announced that the weak Adebayor and Gröneweg will come into the sta=
rt list. On the other side have the sprint great problems in the defence. N=
ext to the hurt Zengel and Valcke also has hurt Fessenmayer now so that he is repr=
esented by the Asenkerschbaumer on Saturday. The midfield players Eickriede and Mathias=
tley still will be cancelled while Janna is complaining of the backache.=20

Expected list Triebendorf: Jarusch - fuller, Asenkerschbaumer, Franz, Leuthe-Norbert Len=
non, parker, Neuhausen, Uller, Tamcke Adebayor
