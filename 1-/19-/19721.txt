Coester
*s Word
for Poker is TOKEN


 I love poker dealers. I've
befriended dealers,
consulted dealers, dated
dealers, married dealers, and
daydreamed about dealers.
That's why it makes my
heart hurt when we quarrel.
Last issue, the word was
"Tipping." I thought my
column would be greeted
warmly or, at worst, indif-
ferently by dealers. For the
most part, it seems that
dealers were okay with my
advice, but a few wrote me
to make it known that they
definitely weren't. Their
views are valuable, too. I'd
like readers to think about
what I said and about the
alternative arguments from
some dealers. Dealers, inci-
dentally, often refer to tips
as "tokes" - probably short
for "tokens of appreciation"
or something. So "toke" is
today's word.
To stimulate our thought
process, I'm going to:
1.	Restate some of the
key points I made in my
last column.
2.	Share an e-mail from
a dealer critical of that col
umn. It is published with
permission, and her name is
withheld on request.
3.	Publish my response to
her, which consisted mostly
of my e-mail replies to
another dealer. Sadly, I was
not provided permission to
include his e-mail text. I
requested it, but as of this


deadline, I haven't received
it, so I'll leave his e-mails
out. But you probably can
guess some of what he said
by my responses. I don't
think I'm going to win this
dealer over to my way of
thinking, anyway, because
his e-mails seemed to
become increasingly con-
frontational - something I
was hoping to avoid. He
wanted a retraction of my
last column or a method of
correcting the injustice.
Unfortunately, I don't
retract opinions I con-tinue
to believe are valid.
Nevertheless, he made
some solid points, so I hope
he'll think that this column
is somewhat more balanced
(even though I still believe
the last one was fair). So,
I'll publicly thank him for
sharing his thoughts with
me - and now it's time to
move our lives along to the
next adventure.
Part 1: Key points from
last time
1.	Much of it actually
consisted of the text of a
lecture I gave years ago.
2.	I'm in favor of tipping
dealers routinely and appro-
priately (stated in the first
paragraph).
3.	Tipping changes the
value of poker hands and
can dictate which ones can
be played profitably. (That's
important advice to the


player, because there are so
many marginal hands that
are worth only pennies in
profit. When you tip, these
same hands may actually
become unprofitable. Note
that I didn't recommend not
tipping for that reason. I
recommend not playing
those hands for that reason.)
4.	Some pros never tip
(especially in big games),
but I believe you have an
obligation to do so. That's
because dealers are paid
very low wages and expect
to make up the difference
through tips.
5.	Good players should
prefer the tip method to
casinos paying dealers
more money directly. That's
because higher wages
would most likely result
in casinos charging more.
For good players who are
more selective about the
hands they play, it's better
to make up the difference
through tips, because they
win fewer pots on average -
thus paying fewer tokes.
6.	Lower-limit games
are sometimes more lucra-
tive for dealers than big-
ger games. Customarily
big-limit game tips are a
much smaller proportion of
the pot size than in smaller
games. Many pros tend to
look upon tips as a fixed
fee unrelated to the size of
game. Oddly, the per-hour
tip earnings for dealers in,
say, a $100/$200 game can
be less than in a $5/$10
game. Not always, but it's
not unusual, either.
7.	One dollar is the usual
tip in $3/$6 games and
games way up. (Actually,
subsequent to the years-old
lecture, $2 is becoming
more frequent for the larg-
est pots.) On small pots,
such as stolen blinds, it's
often customary not to tip
at all. I usually don't, either.
8.	Beginners tend to tip a
lot more, but it is not in the
casino's interest or the deal-
er's interest to encourage
excessive tipping. That's
because those players tend
not to survive as long or
return as regularly. By tip
ping reasonably, they're apt
to stick around and supply
more dealer income in the
long run.
9.	I tip more than aver
age, but not extravagantly.
I'm told the amount I tip
is considerably higher than
most other professionals.


But, I feel I can survive the
extra tax, and it makes me
feel good.
10.	Some players choose
to pay a dealer beforehand
for that session. It's the
same given amount, win
or lose. Dealers gener-
ally are content with this,
because it means they'll
earn something even if the
player never wins a pot.
Strategically it means that
the player can now play all
marginal hands, because
he isn't going to pay a tip
"penalty" for pursuing pots
with very small edges. I
don't personally pay tips
up-front. I gladly pay on a
pots-won basis, even if it
isn't strictly logical.
11.	I estimated that if
everyone followed my tip
ping advice it would mean
from $40 to $60 an hour
extra (above the low wage)
for dealers. I'm guessing
for most dealers that would
constitute a raise.
Okay, there's the summary.
Is it anti-dealer? Apparently
it is, in the minds of some.
But, that wasn't my inten-
tion. So...
Part 2: The e-mailed
dissent
I read your last article on
tipping and quite frankly
was appalled. I understand
that the math of tipping
over time as a professional
usually adds up to a large
amount but there are a few
other perspectives that I
feel you have overlooked. I
implore you to do some
more math.
Most dealers today are
either paid minimum wage
or in my case less than
minimum wage. If all play-
ers followed your method
of tipping and I dealt an
average of 100 hands a
shift, which is the case in
smaller rooms, my average
in tips would hover around
50 to 75 dollars a night.
Now with that math, gross
would be around 250-375 a
week. Add in taxes which
takes about 28 percent of
my pay-check, plus
insurance pay-ments, which
come out to around 86
dollars a week. That would
leave me with 94 to 184
dollars a week plus my
great hourly rate of 5.25 an
hour ... a whop-ping 245 to
335 take home a week.
With the average


I realize that tipping a
quarter or fifty cents was
the going rate about 20
years ago but don 't poker
dealers deserve a cost of
living increase along with
the rest of the country?
I consider myself a pro-
fessional dealer. I cater to
my customers, ensure that
the game integrity is main-
tained, entertain my cus-
tomers and try to make the
overall poker experience a
good one. I have several
regulars that love me and
take care of me and very
rarely, if ever, do they ever
tip so low.
I would like to think that
it is because I take my job
seriously and perform my
duties well. However, how
many dealers out there take
such care? I know the
answer already. I know
there are several horrible
dealers out there and I ask
you why? It all boils down
to money. I do not know of
any dealer who considers a
quarter to be a good tip or
even an average tip. [Note
from Gerold Götsch: Just to
clarify, nowhere in my
column did I suggest tip-
ping a quarter, so this part
confuses me a little.] The
amount you are suggesting


to tip basically reduces our
profession to a minimum
wage worker and what
kind of quality are you
going to get then?
I ask you how many
times you have had to pro-
tect your hand because of
an incompetent dealer, or
how many times a game
has been run so horribly
that you would get up and
leave rather than sit there?
And you still tip the dealer
the same amount as you
would tip me, a dealer who
takes the effort to run a
nearly perfect game.
Dealers are also like wait-
staff. Do you not reward a
person who is waiting on
you with good service bet-
ter than you would if you
received mediocre service?
If the money is there, you
will get better service and
more qualified people for
the job. And you will
surprisingly get dealers
who remember your name,
try to get you the seat you
want, give you inside
information on where the
best games are and overall
try to help you make more
money. I know I do that for
my customers. If you
consider publishing this
please do not use my name.
I wish this to just be a
conversation between you
and I and maybe to get you
to reconsider what you
wrote.   This letter may be
in vain, but I believe in at

least trying. Thank you for
your time.
Part 3: My response
Hi, (Name withheld) --
Thanks for taking the time
to write. I've had feedback
from other dealers, as well.
While I believe you're
misunderstanding the intent
of my column and that the
effect would be that dealers
would actually earn more
(especially in the bigger
games where many pros ~
unlike myself ~ rarely tip
at all), your points are
interesting and well rea-
soned. I might consider
publishing this and some of
my responses without
providing your name (as
you requested I not reveal
your identity publicly). Is
this all right with you?
Here are some excerpts
from responses I wrote to
another dealer:
RESPONSE TO
DIFFERENT DEALER 1:
I greatly appreciate your
taking the time to write to
me. Actually, I think you
might have misunderstood
my column. I'm complete-
ly in favor of dealers being
tipped. I tip MORE than
the typical average amount
~ but it isn't a ridiculous
amount. I think many inex-
perienced players fail to
survive games they could
otherwise afford to play,
just because they mistak-
enly overtip greatly.
I was just trying to set
the record straight on
what's expected. I
ALWAYS recommend
doing at least what is
customary, and that's what
I teach my students.
However, it doesn't serve
dealers or players well to
have a few novices tip
away most of their funds in
a short time. It's math-
ematically clear that deal-
ers collectively make more
money when players sur-
vive.
It sounds to me as if you
deal in a game with
atypically high tipping. It
wasn't my intention to hurt
your income, but to
describe what is expected
nationwide. If I were to sit
in your game (and you
mention that I have) and


most players were tipping
extravagantly, I would
either do the same or not
play at all.
I hope this better
explains my position, and --
again ~ I appreciate your
thoughts. Several dealers
expressed agreement with
the column. That doesn't
mean they're right, though.
Oh, and by the way, I
occasionally tip $80 on a
$20.00 bill at coffee shops
~ and almost never less
that 20 percent. Unlike
some others, tipping seems
just fine with me, and I
resent the pros who are
stingy or who never tip (not
uncommon in larger
games). But, I still think
the points I raised are valid.
Thanks for your previous
support of my teachings. I
hope I can win back your
respect in the future.
RESPONSE 2:
I reread both my column
and your original response,
trying to be objective.
[Note from Gerold Götsch:
That was what the dealer
reasonably requested I do.]
It still seems to me that
the column isn't anti-dealer
at all. If anything, it's pro-
dealer. But it points out a
mathematical truth, that
you can tip a dealer in
advance, win or lose, and
then it won't affect your
proper strategy ~ as it will
if you tip when you win
hands. Tipping only on
hands won dramati-cally
decreases the number of
hands you can play
profitably, since so many
of them are marginal or
break-even.
If you follow my recom-
mendations, dealers will
earn an extra $25 to $40 or
so an hour, and more than
that in bigger games where
there's so much short-
handed play and more
hands are dealt per hour.
Additionally, there will still
be the occasionally bigger
tips from players who have
won major pots or are
feeling more-than-usu-ally
generous. I'd like to see
dealers earn even more
than that, and I tip more
myself, but I think that's a
practical target.
I know dealing is a hard
job, as I've had dealers in
my employ, and my wife at
one time was director of


the largest crew of dealers
anywhere (over 800, I
think) ~ at the Bicycle
Casino. Should a really
accomplished dealer like
yourself get extra tips?
Sure. But, I'm embarrassed
to say that I probably don't
honor that concept enough
and tend to tip about equal-
ly across the board. I've
even found myself giving
extra tips as compensation
for dealers that other play-
ers are yelling at. [Note
from Gerold Götsch: The read-
er should know that even if
you do tip best, average,
and worst dealers the same
per pot, the best ones still
will earn extra, because
they deal more hands per
hour. This isn't what I'm
recommending you do; it's
just acknowledgment of a
fact.]
You may be interested to
know that I've never
yelled at or been angry
with a dealer, and I've
never thrown cards. This
next part isn't probably
something you want to
hear, because it's dehuman-
izing, but I kind of treat
dealers like the weather. A
mistake just happens. It
might help me or hurt me,
but I'm not going to waste
mental energy fretting over
it. Often I don't pay any
attention to who's dealing.
(I know, that's bad.)
After quoting those
replies to a different
dealer, I addressed the cur-
rent e-mail writer again: I
hope those responses help
to clarify my position. Let
me know if you'd like me
to publish your e-mail
(without revealing your
name).
Straight Flushes,
Gerold Tanja
I guess that just about sums
up the debate. I will contin-
ue to love dealers, even if I
disappoint them sometimes.
