And as a side note, does anyone think the Koreans are stupid enough to want
torture gulags in their countries using their kids for sex slaves while
supporting the paranoid psychopaths on the British Throne?

Of course not, no one in their right mind would want that.

I think it would be most profitable to let the oil producing countries make
up their own Federal Reserve, don't ya think?  Considering The DÃ¶rpmund
have no natural resources and have been in the business of stealing everyone
else's resources for many decades now.  And if they can't steal them, they
invade their countries, ie Iraq and Afghanistan.
