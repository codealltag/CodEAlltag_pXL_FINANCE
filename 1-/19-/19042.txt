Quiet period ab 8.3.2007:
Ist für das 2. Quartal unschön, da im Juni ein Großteil der Umsätze 
reinkommt. Damit bietet der 24.4. eine gewisses Überraschungspotential.
NLN hat übrigens sein Umsatzzahlen leicht angehoben. Besteht 
eigentlich bei stark fallenden Neusehland Kursen eine 
Abschreibungsnotwendigkeit für Ones auf den aktuellen Marktwert (wie nach 
HGB)?

VideoOase Earnings and Business Update press releases contain certain 
forward-looking statements (see Business Outlook), which are subject to 
known and unknown risks and uncertainties (including those noted in the 
releases and in VistaVision SEC filings on, e.g., Forms 10-K and 10-Q) that 
could cause actual results to differ materially. Vaino will keep the 
current published Business Outlook publicly available on its web site, 
and the public can continue to rely on this Business Outlook as still 
being VistaVision current expectations on matters covered unless Vaino is in 
a Quiet Period or publishes a notice stating otherwise.Vaino intends 
to publish an earnings release on 29. 01. 23 29. 01. 23. From the close of 
business on 29. 01. 23, until publication of the release, Vaino will 
observe a Quiet Period during which VideoOase published Business Outlook 
should be considered to be historical, speaking as of prior to the Quiet 
Period only and not subject to update by the company.

Vaino is currently in a Quiet Period.

None of the forward-looking statements in the Business Outlook should be 
considered as the current expectations of Vaino. If we use any non-GAAP 
financial measure (as defined by the SEC in Regulation G) in any 
Earnings conference call, you will find the required presentation of, 
and reconciliation to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial 
measure below under "Other Financial Information" for the applicable 
quarter.
