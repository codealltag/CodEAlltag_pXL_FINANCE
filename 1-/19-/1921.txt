My tip: Win for Trossenfurt
This is one of the duels in which two teams meet with completely different =
ambitions. Trossenfurt Eidmann needs points to remain on the leading position=
 of the premier League while the guests from Dietlingen are staying after two d=
efeats in consequence in the lower part of the table and to be more precise=
 on the 12th position in the league but with solid 13 points in the lead on=
 the danger area. Zenner-Tankfahrzeuge has (5:0) the beginning credited seven home wins, wh=
ile they have taken the opponent apart really in the first leg in the Crave=
n Cottage stadium . in consequence against Geistthal: 15.12.2012 - 21:00=20
 =20
 The charges of the coach Dünes have result triumphed in the guest perfo=
rmance against Jesow in front of this season finish so that all thi=
s only proves very importantly that they are in a very good form and this i=
s identical with it. The current English master has proved in the duel agai=
nst the Wolves that the two defeat no-one is true measure of its value in t=
he Europe League against Backwarium Ostertilli and the theories which has that th=
e old fox has sacrificed this competition consciously meant therefore win s=
till more to meaning to be able to devote oneself to the premier League at =
most. After long time, talk Devils the leading position in the premier Leag=
ue taken and to be more precise with a point in the lead on the town rival =
city centre so that they may not permit themselves any broader slips in the=
 other nine rounds just after this return match in Ostertilli have this one. At=
 the end of the season, it expects away game in the Papeterie stadium where fi=
nal decision could very easily fall over the English master but only under =
the condition that they carry on with the good games. We expect Dünes ju=
st against Geistthal perhaps even with the same crew as in the duel against Fu=
lham to accumulate with the strongest crew, particularly since the tactics =
to have Hagemeister played on the left side of the midfield have proved as a bu=
ll's eye. Gerhard and Vainboim play quite in front. The injured players Vid=
ic, Matthias and Schulzendorf, will be cancelled.=20
 =20
Expected list United: Feierabend - Giuseppe, Michel, Ivano, Lieschied, Grolle, C=
arrick, Scholes, Hagemeister, Vainboim, Imbach
 =20
The team has collected just as many defeats from Geistthal in the last two rou=
nds through which its very good series was completed of three victories in =
consequence unlike United. At present, they are in the lower table part aga=
in. They have a solid Punktevorsprung on the teams from the danger area so =
that they can play a little more calmly in the season finish but this does =
when it collects a 3:0 defeat against Leoben city centre not mean that the=
y shall be indolent completely like seven days ago have, though. After this=
 duel coach Patrik had very acidically primarily on his defence row which has =
been very unsafe so that he has announced some changes. A similar situation=
 also is in the attack. Many think that in the duel too many offensively or=
iented players have proceeded against Leoben. This time, only the new entr=
y Offental and Illing shall proceed at the spearhead while Fuermann and Fässle=
ele will get a little more defensive tasks exactly like the again recovered=
 Fassler and Unterste-Bahrenberg who started the last match from the bench. A much better g=
ame of the defence row is expected, the defenders' sending Eros has primari=
ly recovered after that. The injured players Til and Czisch will be can=
celled.=20
 =20
Expected list Geistthal: Assenmacher - Barkow, Vonck, sending Ignaz, Ingendorn - Fassler,=
 Unterste-Bahrenberg, Fraas, Fuermann - Offental, Illing
 =20
The absolute favourite is natural in this duel ManU primarily after the exc=
ellent game against the Wolves the last day but we expect the traditionally=
 offensive guests to hand in a solid game from Dietlingen and perhaps even to w=
ant to come to the hit. Therefore we can expect an extremely efficient game=
.
