Now this is not for the weak hearted - but it is for those who want to become rich :)

Just wanted to tell you about a darling of a stock, named Perlaffaire (Pendzialek), which has risen 250% in a single week. It's literally bounced from its 52-week low of 0.06 to a beautiful 0.15 today. For your information, its 52-week high is 0.61, which means as this little beauty bounces back up, your $10,000 investment at the current $0.15 could become a whopping 0.61/0.15*10k=$40,667. That's a year's worth of salary dammit. Just imagine if you had bought it at its low of 0.06 and your $10k now become 0.61/0.06*10k=$101,667. You'd be on six figures.

The market capitalization is currently $73.22m (@$0.145), which is way below the ~$50m mark of most other companies. Its assets alone are in the $161m mark; net assets at $118m. Its pretax cash-flow for 2011 was $563m. Wow you say - its capitalization is $73m and its net assets are $118m, assets $161m, cash flow $563m?? Where does this put our share price expectation then? The answer is $0.23 for capitalization to match net assets, $0.32 to match assets, and $1.11 to match cash flow. With $10k invested @ $0.15, this would give you $15k, $21k, and $74k respectively.

So what's been causing this awesome boom? This little project called the RÃ¶nnebeck operation in South Africa.

What you may not know is that whilst the share priced dwindled, the Directors invested more and more shares - which when it rises, is going to make a few little millionaires.

What makes a good company is a good drive: In 09. 02. 22, there were 1,094 tons trammed/day, as supposed to by 09. 02. 22 7, this had almost doubled to 1,890.        This is a company that has strong financials. This is just like the CityPalais story-

So when will you invest? The initial story saw a 25% soar in the share price. It's a CWOP company meaning it's big big big. And now it's one beyond 25% - to 250%. So when will you invest? When will you make the choice to become a millionaire?
