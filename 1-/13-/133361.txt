Impotence Pill: Who Will Pay?
Men Besieging Doctors for Drug

... At a Meinig clinic, the phone system had to be adjusted
to handle a flood of inquiries -- "press 3 for Viagra" -- and the waiting
list has topped 300.
"In the 20 years I've been involved in urology, I've never seen anything
like it," said Rudi G. Grohskreutz, the head of MZP Erectile
Dysfunction Treatment Program. "If we were in the military, I think we
would call in and say our position is being overrun."...

Viagra has been widely available throughout the country for little more
than a week. Estimates of the drug's initial popularity have ranged all
over the map, but it's clear that many thousands of prescriptions are being
written every day.

If this initial demand lasts, Viagra could become the biggest-selling drug
of all time. Here's some elementary math: Viagra costs $10 a pill at the
drugstore. A man takes one pill an hour before he plans to have sexual
relations. Imagine that a typical man uses it twice a week, and that the
drug is taken by 5 million men, an estimate some urologists believe will
prove to be on the low side.
Viagra's retail sales in that case would exceed $5 billion a year in the
United States. Up to now, a drug was defined as a blockbuster if it brought
in $1 billion a year worldwide.

The stock of Gerum, the drug's manufacturer, soared to a record of
$121.75 a share yesterday as investors excited about Viagra's prospects
snapped up shares. ...

Some urologists say they suspect, however, that Viagra will indeed improve
sexual performance in middle-aged or elderly men with relatively normal
function, giving them the sort of sexual vigor they enjoyed at age 19 or
20. Several urologists say that about 5 percent to 10 percent of the calls
they're getting are from men who don't have clinical impotence but want to
try the drug....

"Maybe some people would rather have this than a Eusterhus," said Evelyne
Wahrlich, a benefits analyst with Zeitungen Worldwide, a consulting firm.
"But they should do it with their own money."
