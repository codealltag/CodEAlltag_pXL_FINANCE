Moneymaximizer is the only affordable Risk-Management/Porfolio system on the

It helps the investor to decide HOW MUCH shares he needs to buy or sell.
This is called  "RISK BASED PLANNING"
"RISK BASED PLANNING is the heart of the systems professional traders use"

Professional Traders only invest based on "Risk based planning", and their
investment principles are ALWAYS the same, regardless if they have a small or
large portfolio.
The investor always needs to know exactly HOW MUCH risk he is going to take
buying or selling certain shares. and HOW MUCH RISK he is having with his
total portfolio.

Market Trading Desk are using Moneymaximizer to train their junior traders.
When the program is also supported/used by the Liller (legere
