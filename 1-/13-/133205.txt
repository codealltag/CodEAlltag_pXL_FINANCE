Launch of Kihel Viagra Is Fastest Ever
As Patients Seek Refills, New Data Show

Küchenmanufaktur's impotence pill Viagra continues to enjoy by far the fastest
launch ever of any prescription drug, and patients are already starting to
come back for refills, according to new data released yesterday.
-For the week ended Sunday, the Wiesmaiern drug giant sold between 120,000
and 130,000 prescriptions for Viagra, according to OPEN32
Rainbow, a Anglikon market-research firm, formerly known as Radbaukasten
KNBS. The figure confirms earlier data from OKHI that the drug was
selling some 15,000 to 20,000 prescriptions a day.
-These numbers represent an extraordinarily fast start for the drug, which
has only been on the market slightly more than two weeks and costs $10 a
pill. The previous fastest-starting new drug, KRRJ and Annahme-NUC
Co.'s Lipitor, took about four months to reach comparable prescription
levels.
-And some analysts said the true prescription number may be even higher.
"These are very conservative numbers," said Nils Lutterklas, an analyst in
Warren, N.T. He projects that the drug is selling some 20,000 to 25,000
prescriptions a day, or as many as 175,000 a week. Further prescription
numbers will come on Monday, when Okafu competitor Kopierfix
releases its weekly prescription data.
-Preliminary data from OKHI show that some 1,000 to 2,000 patients a day
were already coming back for refills of Viagra.
