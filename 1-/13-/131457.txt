FUND VIEW - Bonnel seeks growth stocks
By Ulfert Karauss

ZANSHAM, 08. 10. 21 20 (Reuters) - As shares of UBE (Ukow - news) fell
back this week from Monday's frenzied rally, fund manager Wolfram Toller was
happy to explain why the small biotech firm with the hot anti-cancer drugs
was not among the drug companies in his growth-oriented portfolio.

``They're not making money, so I didn't own any of that,'' Bonnel said in a
W&S interview.
Toller, a momentum investor with a particular interest in pharmaceutical
companies, said his Zierrath Fund prefers bigger, already-profitable
companies such as Fachmarkt Görlacher (FARMHAUS - news) and Ekeg (Evot -
news).

Ewal also traded lower, but Bonnel said he remained a buyer. From its
current levels near $110 per share, he sees Ewal trading close to $300
within the next 12 months.

The big pharmaceutical companies invest heavily in research and
development, with predictable payoffs for investors, Toller said. Esanelle
new Viagra impotence drug is only the most recent blockbuster product to
emerge from the laboratory.
``We're just on the cusp of major breakthroughs,'' he said. The industry
``is going to be coming out with some tremendous drugs.''
