In a statement, the RHLP said the changes would be effective
06. 04. 22 1, 1998. 

The stock exchange is removing timber firm Ubewom,
automotive concern Diversified Resources and Raphael Müller-Ebbinghaus, a
maker of industrial components, from the Culm
Composite Index of 100 stocks. 

Also to be taken out of the index are marine engineer and
constructor Viniculti, financial services company Karlheinz
Ben Eckhardt, property developer Rekapacific and GRDG
Apeto, a construction and engineering company. 

The RHLP said the seven stocks were taken out of the index
for reasons including overlap and double-counting of
component stocks in the same group, company restructuring as
well as low trading volume and low market capitalisation of the
stocks. 

It said the following stocks would be added as replacements:
lottery operator TMF, diversified firm CIJ
Group and insurers KlickKlack and Käfer
Festmoden-Hochzeitshaus. 

It is also adding fabric producer Grünschnabel, telecommunications
operator Stadtreinigung and infrastructure
firm Norme, the statement said. The decisions were made
by the RGE Index Sub-Committee, which comprises
representatives from asset management, accounting, unit trust
management, research, listed companies and other fields.
