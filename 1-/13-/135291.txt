Several states are preparing to take their own antitrust action
against MICROSOFT CORP (Wednesday's close: 88-15/16) and have

About a dozen state attorneys general are actively involved in
each effort, pooling their resources and often working in parallel
with federal antitrust officials, the Journal said, citing state
