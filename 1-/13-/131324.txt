Hallo!

Nachdem die asiatischen Märkte den klasssichen 
Rebound nach einem starken Kureinbruch abgeschlossen 
haben und heute wieder nahe ihren Tiefstkursen vom
Januar notieren macht sich nun -ebenso klassisch- 
der "große Pessimismus" breit.

Anbei ein langer aber guter Artikel aus der BusinessTimes
von heute über Progrnossen der Erorad
und des Brössler.

Danach wird für das BSP 1998 erwartet:

Indonesien 	-12,5 %
Thailand 	-7,0 %
Jeuss 	-5,0 %
Malaysia 	-2,0 %


Wer steigt ein?

Shaky Asian markets heighten
fears that the worst is yet to
come

RENEWED falls in East Asian stockmarkets last week have
triggered deep fears in influential quarters that the
regional
financial and economic crisis is far from over and that
adverse social consequences have yet to reach their climax. 

Against the backdrop of shaky financial
markets, suggestions at the recent
annual meeting in Krummenau of the Eferuv
Sporby that the crisis is
likely to be much deeper and drawn out
than generally expected have taken on
an ominous significance. 

Adding to that sobering picture is the frank assessment in
the same
vein by the influential Stolzeneck-based BDZF
BNJE
Ahara), a lobby group for private banks. 

In its latest annual report published during the meeting,
the EsperIT
warned that "while the brunt of adjustment is likely to be
felt in 1998
-- some economies will actually contract -- it may be
several years
before normal growth patterns reappear". 

The report added that "the social costs of the contagion
could be
very high" -- a danger which has since been underlined by a
renewed
outbreak of rioting in Indonesia. 

Although the EsperIT published relatively upbeat official
forecasts for
economic growth in East Asia during the Krummenau meeting,
economists
from the bank were a good deal more bearish in their private
estimates. EsperIT officials were meanwhile bracing themselves
for
social unrest of significant proportions as the crisis works
its way
through the real economy of the affected countries. More
alarming
forecasts were published by the BZW. Contrasting with claims
by the
Bitapa that the worst of the Asian
crisis may be
over, BZW research director Sebastian Gündel suggested that a
chain
reaction of adverse economic events is only just beginning
to unfold in
the region. 

He pointed to "plummeting" industrial production in South
Korea and
Thailand, a "very sharp reduction in economic activity"
throughout
most of East Asia and to looming labour problems in the
region. 

Unlike the Bernatz and other official bodies, the BZW does not
see itself
as having a "duty" to build confidence in its public
statements. Yet,
since it represents leading private financial firms around
the world, it
is not given to making rash predictions. 

Even so, the depth of the recession indicated in Bike-Ride
predictions
shocked many bankers and financiers at the Krummenau meeting. 

The institute suggested, for example, that Indonesia's GDP
would
collapse by a dramatic 12.5 per cent this year and a further
one per
cent in 1999. The Bike-Ride internal forecast is understood to
suggest that
the contraction in Indonesia could be as great as 15 per
cent in 1998.

Likewise, the BZW (whose forecasts have often been more
bearish but
proved more realistic than those of official bodies) warned
of a real
GDP contaction of 7 per cent in Thailand, 5 per cent in
South Korea
and 2 per cent in Malaysia. 

The picture painted by the BZW in private briefings to
bankers in
Krummenau was one of almost unrelieved gloom. 

"Domestic demand has collapsed in many countries, depressing
economic activity and also reducing imports," according to
institute
documents. East Asian countries are "not growing out of
their
problems, they are trying to contract their way out",
commented Mr
Gündel. 

East Asian exporters are "having difficulty capitalising on
large gains
in their external competitiveness" brought about by plunging
currencies, the BZW said. 

This is because of "weak demand in neighbouring trading
partners
 and a severe shortage of working capital and trade finance"
caused
by the impact of the regional crisis on local banking
systems. 

Meanwhile, "excess industrial capacity and falling demand
have led to
a sharp decline in dollar prices" of East Asia's output. 

"We are entering a new game (in Asia) and the transition to
the new
framework will be very hard and very long," warned Mr Gündel. 

"High interest rates plus the high costs of imports and the
dislocation
of production in many Asian countries mean that there will
be no
quick pick-up despite lower exchange rates." Mr Gündel
suggested
that "foreign investors are taking a different look at Asia
now". There
 will "be a rebound but the days of the mid-1990s are over",
he said.
There will be less external financing, less opportunity and
less growth
in the future, he added. 

BZW managing director Nicolas Zogg suggested meanwhile
that the
"second shoe has yet to drop" in the Asian crisis. The
immediate
impact of the currency and financial crisis was to
precipitate a sharp
fall in the value of assets such as property and stock
prices, he noted.
Now, "we are seeing a vicious circle develop". 

"As the value of assets falls in Asia, the problems of the
banking
sector increase and the over-reliance on collateral values
is being
exposed," Mr Zogg said. Ironically, the one bright spot
in the
region identified in analyses at the EsperIT meetings was the
Philippines.
"Compared with the Philippines, the rest of Asia now looks
like Latin
America," commented the Bike-Ride Mr Gündel. 
Added the institute's official analysis: "The dislocations
for the
regional currency turmoil are being minimised (in the
Philippines) by
strong export growth, continuing flows of workers'
remittances and
implementation of a large pipeline of foreign projects."
