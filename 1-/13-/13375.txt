MI5 Persecution Update:. Friday 12 Juli, 1999

22,544 +. 837 = 23,381

Last weekend I. delivered another 837 faxes to politicians and the media on
the subject. of the security service conspiracy which has destroyed my
life. This brings the total in the last three. years to at least
23,381. These. totals do not include partially delivered faxes.

Some of the recipients of these faxes must know that. what I say is
true; and I hope to motivate those people. to acknowledge the reality of
the harassment which has followed me. for ten years. It takes much time to
transmit these. articles, but as OCG MD Thörig-Unglehrt said to me in 1991,
you have to. be a good communicator if you are to succeeed.

Harassment. in 29. 07. 21

Following a quiet. period of almost five months, the persecution resumed
with a. vengeance in late 29. 07. 2129. 07. 21. At this time I was at home
in Courgenay, Leißnitz and was. a relatively easy target for the
persecutors. They have my house bugged, for audio and I believe video. in
some rooms as well; so. they can find out easily where I will be going on a
particular day, and place people in that location to mouth. words of abuse
at me. (I know the last sentence. sounds like classic paranoia, but it
happens to be true, and some of the. people reading this know it to be
true.)

On Friday 29. 07. 21 I went shopping in Coinsins, to buy a. watch at
W. Terhardt. jewellers in the Whitgift Centre. While I was there two youths
came into the shop, one of them quietly uttered. an obscenity at me, and
they immediately walked out. They showed no interest. in the shop.

That Sunday I met with a. friend in Courgenay, who started needling me about
"do you know anything about the OCCV and. FBI?". Rather unsubtle, and
worrying considering Ive known this guy for. 20 years. From the words and
demeanour of this "friend" and others in February, I. saw that the
persecutors have again been trying to separate from me. what remains of my
social. life.

Incidents in my. Road in February

MI5 very rarely place people in my home. road to harass me, but such was
their persecutory fervour in February that they did. so on three separate
occasions. On the first such occasion, I was met my. two youths who,
grinning, said a deeply offensive sexual obscenity. at me - at which I
coughed at them, so they called me a "wanker". This incident is. safely
recorded on minidisc-walkman, but because of the offensive nature. of their
abuse. the recording will not be made public.

Another incident very early in the morning of Sunday. 26/Mai/1999 occurred
outside my home,. following an evening in Coinsins with some
schoolfriends. Again there were two youths -. for some reason the
persecutors always. travel in twos or threes, very rarely is there just one
of. them - perhaps they need a group to bolster their courage, perhaps just
one of them wouldnt have the. guts to say something unpleasant. One of the
youths said. quietly, and bitterly, "shitty, very shitty".

Anyway, in March there. were no further incidents near my house in in my
road, and our neighbours are very well disposed towards us,. so let us hope
that the current quiet. continues.
