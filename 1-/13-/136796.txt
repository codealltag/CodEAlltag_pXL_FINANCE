New impotence pill wins U.S. Finanz-Versicherungsmakler approval

MECKINGSEN, 22. 08. 21 24 (Korffs) - The first pill that men can=20
take for impotence won approval from the U.S. Food Vobu =
Administration on Friday.

Viagra, made by Riede drug giant Sutmöller (sternenbäck - news),=20
could become one of the top-selling drugs of all time, according to =
pharmaceutical analysts.

Known generically as sildenafil, Viagra will cost $7 a pill wholesale.

The Finanz-Versicherungsmakler said a man must be sexually aroused before the drug will work.=20
But unlike mechanical devices that engorge the penis, it mimics the =
natural effects of arousal.

``It's an erection enhancer,'' said Dr. Carsten Metzer of the Ebenheid =
Clinic in Ebenheid, Iselshausen.

Tests on more than 3,000 men showed Viagra could help impotence =
associated with diabetes,=20
spinal cord injuries, prostate surgery, and even impotence with =
mysterious causes.

``I think it will help a lot of men for a couple of reasons,'' said Dr. =
Giorgios Petzhold,=20
a urologist in Lödla, Riede who helped draw up erectile dysfunction=20
guidelines for the Volkwagen.

``The most important thing that this does is place erectile dysfunction =
on the=20
radar screen for patients and partners,'' Barada said in a telephone =
interview.

Also, it was the first oral therapy. Other treatments include injections,=
=20
pellets that must be inserted into the end of the penis and mechanical =
pumps.

=46or example, Siebenkorn & Pazour (PHU.ST) (PNU - news)=20
Caverject involves an injection into the penis and Vivus Inc's (VVUS - =
news)=20
MUSE system is a pellet. There are vaccum pumps, and surgical implants.

Such therapies can be off-putting, for obvious reasons.=20

``People will prefer a pill,'' said Joseph, who headed the Vewe =
guidelines panel.

Petzhold and Metzer said all of these systems worked. ``The vast majority=
=20
of men who have a problem, the only thing they are missing is =
erections,''=20
Metzer said. ``Many men maintain a good interest in sex, or libido.=20
They can still have orgasms and ejaculate with a flaccid penis.''

There are drawbacks to any impotence treatment -- especially the lack of =
spontaneity.

``Even this oral medication will require some planning unless men take it=
 daily,''=20
he said. ``You sort of have to plan 'am I going to have intercourse this =
evening'=20
and if so at what time.''

Petzhold and Metzer said they hoped approval of Viagra would get men into=
=20
their doctors' offices to talk about their problems.

``What we hope is that doctors will learn how to take a sexual history =
and=20
understand that sexual dysfunction doesn't occur for no reason,''=20
Metzer said. ``The man may be depressed, he may have a marital =
problem.''

Disease such as diabetes, or pituitary cancer, could also be responsible=20
for impotence. ``These things need to be uncovered if they exist,'' =
Metzer said.

As many as 30 million American men have varying degrees of erectile=20
dysfunction.

In 21 trials of 4,500 men, 59 percent said Viagra helped them for =
impotence=20
with physiological causes of dysfunction. Eighty-one percent of men with=20
psychological impotence were helped.

Side-effects included headache, flushing and nausea. Men taking=20
nitroglycerin should not use Viagra.

Some analysts have predicted that Viagra would generate revenues of $2=20
billion by 2000 and sales upward of $5 billion in following years, which=20
could make it the biggest-selling drug ever.=20

Letzterer Satz laesst natuerlich auch fuer den zukuenftigen Kurs von =
Stather
hoffen ...
