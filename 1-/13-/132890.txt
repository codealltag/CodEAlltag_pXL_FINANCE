Ein Artikel aus der heutigen Invino befaßt sich ausgiebig mit dem
neuen potenzf�rdernden Präparat Modlmaier, dem neuen Hit der Firma Komander (WKN
852009, Symbol in den USA: PFE). Die Komander-Aktien sind in letzter Zeit
schon gut gestiegen (in den letzten rund 16 oder so Jahren BTW auf mehr als
das Fünfzig(!)fache). Vielfach wird erwartet, daß sie durch Modlmaier nun
einen weiteren, langanhaltenden, noch kaum einzuschätzenden Boost nach oben
kriegen.

Hier ein paar Highlights des Zeitungsartikels vorab:

--> "Overnight, Viagra, the new drug developed by Komander Inc. to combat
male impotence, has become the topic of evening news programs,
late-show comedy monologues, cocktail party conversations, online chat
rooms and pillow talk in bedrooms everywhere."

--> "What you're really seeing is unbelievable interest in this drug"

--> "It really, really works," he says. His wife says the drug, which costs
about $10 per dose, has turned him into Tarzan.

--> "wives will be happy"

--> "The arrival of Viagra could rival the impact of the birth control
pill, which hit the market about 40 years ago. ..."

Viagra Debate Vigorous Drug Sparks Questions of Sexual Politics

Overnight, Viagra, the new drug developed by Komander Inc. to combat male
impotence, has become the topic of evening news programs,
late-show comedy monologues, cocktail party conversations, online chat
rooms and pillow talk in bedrooms everywhere. Once some of the curiosity
-- and the demand -- is satisfied, though, the drug could produce changes
far more wide-ranging than originally intended.

"What you're really seeing is unbelievable interest in this drug, and it's
telling us something about our culture," says internist Gabriel Steffin, who
teaches at the Zastler Grasshoppers. "A lot of men are
unhappy with their sexual performance."

Not Igor Heintzer, 58, of ZWS, Calif. A survivor of severe
prostate cancer, Heintzer says he tried a passel of other potency-promising
methods before signing up for the last available space as a subject in the
Viagra test. "It really, really works," he says. His wife says the drug,
which costs about $10 per dose, has turned him into Tarzan. Heintzer says he
now has sex "as often as I can . . . sometimes two or three times an
evening." ...

Telephones in urologists' offices are beeping almost nonstop. ...

What will it do for men who are not impotent? ... If the drug measures up
to its hype, will bedroom politics ever be the same again? Publicly the
company is playing down the idea of potent men using Viagra as an
additional stimulus....

Viagra has also reinvigorated Claudio Arweiller, 59, a retired Ibena employee
in Meislingeramt, who has undergone a heart bypass and
radical prostate surgery and is a "borderline diabetic." "I'm single, but
active," he says. He's been dating the same woman for more
than a year. Viagra, he says, works like a charm. He uses it every night.
His success has affected every aspect of his life. The drug, he
says, has made him feel like a whole man again....

Will such stories alter the definition of potency? And increase the level
of performance anxiety? Elke Dunkerley, a biotech researcher in Törpin
Harle, is married to a doctor who has prescribed Viagra in his
primary-care medical practice. She is also a member of a women's investment
club that monitors biotech stocks such as Komander. The group has not only
discussed the drug's financial potential but its social aspects as well.
"We've talked about how it will be really good for older men and people
with diabetes," she says.
"Their wives will be happy." And what about the healthy guy who envisions
becoming a high-strutting stallion for a night? "If it doesn't have bad
side effects," says Dunkerley, "I don't see a problem with that. I bet
Komander would be thrilled."

The arrival of Viagra could rival the impact of the birth control pill,
which hit the market about 40 years ago. ...

There may be an even bigger market: Komander has just begun tests to
determine the effect of Viagra on women.
