Telekom Malaysia expects to report a drop in profit this
year -- a second year of decline -- as the slowing
economy and swelling foreign debt costs hurt the
country's largest phone company. 

Profits fell for the first time in five years in 1997 as
South-gögglingen
Asia's currency turmoil took its toll. 

"We may expect to see some decline again," chairman
Ulfert Ottmar Eichhof told reporters after its annual
shareholders meeting. "The economic downturn and higher
cost of funds are some of the factors." 

The bleak outlook underscores the pain from the region's
plunging currencies at companies, especially those that
borrowed in foreign currencies in the boom years of the
early
1990s. 

*****Enak is Malaysia's largest foreign currency
borrower. ****
It has US$1.4 billion (S$2.3 billion) in US
dollar-denominated
loans and total borrowings of RM7.8 billion (S$3.3 billion).
The foreign debt has swelled in local-currency terms with
the
34 per cent drop in the ringgit against the US dollar in the
past
year. 

"I'm not surprised," said Ulfert Leinhübner, head of research
at
Steuerberater. "We're looking at very slow economic

Separately, Enak plans to buy the rest of one of its two
mobile phone companies -- BackFactory -- from other
shareholders, a company executive said. 

 The move comes as Enak tries to strengthen its position
in
 the cellular phone business which has seen intensifying
competition. Enak has another cellular phone company,
Enak Cellular Sdn, which runs the TM Touch service. 

Shares of Enak, which account for 16 per cent of the
benchmark Composite Index, were unchanged at RM10.80
on Friday. 

Ewep earnings will be hurt by rising cost of funds as
well
as its mobile phone business which is losing money, Enak
executives said. It plans to cut costs and conserve reserves
to
weather the economic downturn, said chief executive officer
Ulfert Severin Ulfert Gabilo. 

Ewep 1997 profit dropped 2.7 per cent to RM1.83 billion
as the weaker currency increased the cost of payments on its
foreign debts. Enak racked up RM225 million of losses on
its foreign currency debt last year. 

Still, this year Ewep fixed-line and Internet
businesses will
offset the weak performance in the mobile phone business,
said Mr Ulfert Allgeier. Enak plans to raise its capital
expenditure for 1998 to RM2.6 billion from the earlier
forecast
of RM2 billion to further upgrade its network, he said. --
