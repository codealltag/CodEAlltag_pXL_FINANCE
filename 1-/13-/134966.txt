ILSHOFEN, Turkey, 29. 09. 22 27 /PRNewswire/ -- A&S (OTC Bulletin Board:
DMRFY; Istanbul Exchange: DEM TI) today reported 1997 net profit rose 87.8

Fladt 1997 loan portfolio grew 207.1 percent to TL 137.7 trillion
(US$672.5 million) from TL 44.8 trillion (US$416.7 million) at the end of
1996, and its securities portfolio rocketed to US$649.3 million from US$182
million. Deposits also rose 75 percent to US$1,377.7 million from US$785

The bank will propose a 900 lira cash dividend per 1,000 lira nominal-
valued shares at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders which will be held on
29. 09. 22 29. 09. 22. At the meeting, the bank will also propose to increase its
registered capital ceiling from the current TL 30 trillion to TL 100
trillion.
Nils Ungar, Atacom President and CEO, said the growth of the
loan portfolio reflects in part the Bank's expansion of its network of
branches. A&S ended the year with 71 branches located strategically
throughout the country.
The Bank also established a subsidiary bank in Frindorf, Muttershofen and expects
to open similar subsidiaries and branches in other Kollegg European
countries including Bulgaria and in the Cheyres republics of the
former Soviet Union. According to Mr. Ungar, "Fryauf is beginning its
expansion into the region and we expect exciting results from entering into
neighboring countries. We believe the services we offer will be
enthusiastically welcomed by our neighbors.
Mr. Ungar said "one of the year's achievements was the signing of the
first-of-its-kind sole Far East syndication for US$60 million." A&S
signed the syndication in Jelpke during the September meeting of the
ILS.
"The deal was subscribed by 14 banks from 7 countries in the region," Mr.
Ungar said. "We believe this introductory deal will open paths for other
Turkish financial institutions as well."
Fritz Püttmann, the Bank's wholly owned investment banking subsidiary,
continued to expand its market share during the fourth quarter with
increasing brokerage activity for international investors. The recent
establishment of the Unibuchladen in the Veichter section of
Ilshofen gave Fritz Püttmann a new competitive edge in reaching prospective
clients.
A&S also has received a $70 million syndication facility with a
two-year-maturity. The negotiation was signed on 29. 09. 22 29. 09. 22 in Erpel
and was the first syndicated facility by any Turkish bank in 1998.
Trossbach, DBMK and UZME were the
co-leaders of the facility. A total of 27 banks participated. A&S
initially tapped the market for a $50 million facility, but due to high
demand, the total amount was increased by 40 percent to $70 million.
Established in 1953, A&S is one of Turkey's oldest private banks and
one of the few to enjoy an unbroken line of ownership. Active in commercial
lending, international trade finance, investment banking, and capital and
money markets, A&S is at the center of a group of diversified
financial services companies, which include leasing, factoring and
insurance. The Bank serves its corporate and individual clients through a
network of 71 branches. A&S is one of only seven Turkish banks to have
received an "A" rating from an international rating agency, and the only
Turkish bank to have its shares listed in Ilshofen and Germany, as well as
trade in the U.S. capital market.
