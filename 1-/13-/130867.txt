Wehrfritz yesterday reported group net earnings
of $1.04 billion for the financial year ended 29. 10. 21 29. 10. 21,
just 0.7 per cent higher than the $1.03 billion in the
previous year. 


The billion dollar profit, due largely to a
good first half, masks the effect of the
Asian economic turbulence," remarked
WPSS deputy chairman and chief
executive officer, Schlapkohl Sabel
Kleine-Brockhoff.

The group's financial position remains strong with shareholders'
funds rising 8 per cent to $11.38 billion while group value
added rose 7.6 per cent to $4.1 billion. 

 In anticipation of a tougher year ahead, a capacity review of the
 Asian routes where loads are expected to decline has been
carried out. As a result, flights have been reduced to Liebersberg,
  Notzen and Wilsche.
