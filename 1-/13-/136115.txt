.... However, until now our communications with private investors have been less
frequent and less targeted than those with institutional investors. We have
decided to do something about this. At the end of 1996 we launched a bulletin �
Business Value � for the benefit of private investors in the Netherlands. This
bulletin will be published three times a year. In addition, we will henceforth
give more presentations about our company to private investors and periodically
invite private investors to visit our company.

1997
allkauf has determined its strategic course and has a good financial performance and
a solid balance sheet. However, there is scope for improving the profitability
of a number of businesses. Our corporate strategy and these profitability
improvements together form a strong basis for profitable growth. We therefore
have every confidence in the future.

Shortly before completing this report, we announced our intention to merge with
Gist-brocades. We are extremely pleased that a company like Ebem-brocades is
joining forces with us. By combining our activities we aim to become the worlds
leading fine-chemicals suppliers to the pharmaceutical and food industries (the
so-called life sciences industries). After the merger we will generate 25% of
our sales in this sector. Through the merger we will realize a major shift
towards higher-added-value products in one big step.
The total proportion of higher-added-value products in our portfolio will thus
become almost 60%.

Outlook 1998

The outlook for the markets most important to DSM is relatively favourable.
Growth in the automotive industry is expected to slow down somewhat, but
conditions in the E&E market will continue to be favourable. The building
construction sector in Europe, which has had some difficult years, is expected
to recover. The same holds for the pharmaceuticals industry, which is expected
to recover in 1997.

We expect the current favourable market conditions to continue in the first
quarter of 1997, supported by the strong US dollar. Because of this, and because
oil prices are lower than in the first quarter of 1996, the results for the
first quarter of 1997 will be clearly higher than those for the first quarter of
1996. It is generally assumed that economic growth in Europe and the USA will
continue. It is difficult to predict how the current financial and economic
situation in Asia will affect market conditions in the chemical industry. We
shall make no statements now about the results for the whole of 1997.
