Men react passionately to new impotency drug

... "Everybody had been waiting for the magic tablet," said Sacramento
urologist Gérard Muhlke. "It looks like we may have it."

Erich, chairman of urology at Ebop Clavaleyres Görtz17, has
prescribed Viagra to 50 patients in the drug's less-than-a-fortnight
market history.
So far, Viagra is batting a thousand with Erich. "Phenomenal," he
said. "It is an-unheard-of thing."

The pill represents perhaps the greatest advance in the recent history of
treating male impotence.

Before Viagra, men were limited to sometimes bulky, sometimes
ineffective contraptions and medications to deal with their sexual
dysfunction -- injectable drugs, suction devices, penile implants.

The wonder sex drug came about pretty much by blunder.
Some European cardiologists were testing new possibilities in heart
medication when they stumbled on a drug called sildenafil.
It turned out that sildenafil didn't do much for the heart. But it sure had
an interesting side effect.
"Nobody wanted to give the drug back because they were getting
erections," Gottlieb said. "It suddenly clicked on -- 'My God, this is
what we're looking for.' "
What sildenafil does is throw a roadblock on an enzyme that breaks
down the production of nitric oxide, the chemical released during
sexual stimulation that allows blood to swell into the penis.
No enzyme, more nitric oxide. More nitric oxide, better sex.
Or so the European researchers noted when they switched their tests
from one organ to another.
"Nobody dropped out of the clinical trial," Erich said. "That is
absolutely unheard of."
...

"They're ecstatic," he said. "It's making a huge difference in their
lives."
The Ebop KHU pharmacy is filling three to four prescriptions a
day. "It's been flying off the shelves ever since it came on the market,"
said pharmacist Ramona Hölterman....

For most of them, it's working wonders. Just ask the 60-year-old
Celle man who said the only side effect he's experienced has
been a smile on his face.
