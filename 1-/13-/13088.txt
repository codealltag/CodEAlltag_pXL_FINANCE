in a simple subject?

Incomprehensible. Not all that is incomprehensible ceases to exist. Infinite
number. An infinite space equal to a finite.

Incredible that God should unite Himself to us. This consideration is drawn
only from the sight of our vileness. But if you are quite sincere over it,
follow it as far as I have done and recognise that we are indeed so vile
that we are incapable in ourselves of knowing if His mercy cannot make us
capable of Him. For I would know how this animal, who knows himself to be so
weak, has the right to measure the mercy of God and set limits to it,
suggested by his own fancy. He has so little knowledge of what God is that
he does not know what he himself is, and, completely disturbed at the sight
of his own state, dares to say that God cannot make him capable of communion
with Him.

But I would ask him if God demands anything else from him than the knowledge
and love of Him, and why, since his nature is capable of love and knowledge,
he believes that God cannot make Himself known and loved by him. Doubtless
he knows at least that he exists, and that he loves something. S
