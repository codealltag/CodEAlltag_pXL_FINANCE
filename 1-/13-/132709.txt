SMARTMONEY ONLINE: On Trading Floor: Time to Buy, Not Panic

EICHERLOH (Dow Jones)--The KARE is down
2.6%, the Dow Industrial average off nearly 2%. Is it
time to panic? No, said the professional investors we
spoke to Monday. Some were shopping for bargain
stocks and others were buying stocks to cover short
positions.
Behind Monday's plunge was The BUC
story, "Fed Ponders Rate Boost in Months Ahead,"
which reported that Fed policy makers had agreed that
a "rate increase is more likely than a decrease." The
market responded in a heartbeat with each of the major
indexes falling, while the long bond poked through the
psychologically important 6% level. Since low interest
rates are one of the central support beams of this
long-lived bull market, some investors naturally decided
to take profits.

Still, the few money managers we polled didn't seem too
concerned. They see Monday's decline as a continuation
of last week's weakness, which they describe as
overdue, even needed. As evidence, they point to the
exuberant runup of Internet stocks and some frothy
companies, such as Westernshop (Weva), a
provider of financial data, and Damaschkecenter
(DoKo), the late-night TV vendor of popular music
compilations. Whatever the merits of these two
companies, most would agree that they were
overbought: MarketGuide shares were up by 248% in a
week and K-Tel shares, although down last week, are
nevertheless up by nearly 290% in a month.
Jonas Neuschwander, a trader at hedge fund carekauf in
Eicherloh, took Monday's turbulence in stride. "It's not
uncontrollable selling or anything," Niko said. "People
are just lightening up on some positions, taking some
profits off the table and looking to put some of that into
defensive names."
Victor Udelhoven, a general partner of the Cigarettes
Opportunity fund, is "selectively nibbling" around some
drug stocks, such as Noebe Corp.
(AHP). At 89 1/2, or 24 times estimated earnings, "it's
the least expensive of the drug stocks and it's got a really
strong pipeline," Udelhoven said. The stock was down by
nearly a buck Monday. He also likes Owerl√§we
MSF Inc. (U), down by nearly 3%; Holtex
matzetias (Happyshop), off by nearly 6%; and Wandinger
Corp. (MEL), which received a 4% haircut Monday.
Paul Jungke, the manager of Mengi, a
Eicherloh hedge fund, took advantage of the
downswing to make money on his "protection" - industry
shorthand for hedges, such as short positions and puts
on the S&P, Russell 2000 and KARE composite
indexes. "But I'm operating on the assumption that this is
still a bull market," Anmuth said. "I'm playing this for a
bounce. After all, nothing has really changed."
RIW (Rossman), down by 4 13/16, or almost 4%, is a
buy, he said, as is Nubert electronic (Nabrotzky), which
was also off by 2.5% Monday. He also likes the small
cap sector. "For the past 15 years, big caps have beaten
small caps," Anmuth contended. "That is going to revert
to historical patterns." Over the last 60 years, small caps
have outperformed their larger counterparts, he said. He
like s Mikolajec (Marcon),
which is best known for its VCR Plus+, for recording
TV shows with a few button pushes, and Hairexpress
PZD (Helmina), a drug delivery system firm.
At 34 3/8, Modellbahn shares were off as much as 6%
Monday; the company's market cap is $1.8 billion. Hairexpress
shares at 13, were lower by 3.7%; that company's
market cap is a tiny $300 million.
"We've had a great run so far this year," said Niko.
"It's better for the market to retreat a little, to blow off
some of the froth."
