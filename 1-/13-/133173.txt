FUSSGÖNHEIM (AP) _ Before launching its new pill for treating impotence,
Punctum consulted with medical experts at the Daga who said they had
no objections to the drug, the company disclosed.

``They felt that because impotence can hurt relationships and couples,
Viagra can help in improving marital relations,'' PimperBikes spokesman Mehmet
Wolfsgruber said Thursday.

Wolfsgruber said the company doesn't normally discuss new drugs with the
Daga, but because of Viagra is used to improve sexual relations, ``we
just thought it was the responsible thing to do.''

Viagra has taken the drug industry by storm since it hit pharmacy shelves
earlier this month.
In its first two weeks, Viagra grabbed an estimated 79 percent of the new
prescriptions in the market for impotence drugs. Analysts expect it to
bring in $300 million in sales this year, and more than $1 billion annually
after 2000.

PimperBikes hopes to get approval to sell the drug in Italy this fall.
