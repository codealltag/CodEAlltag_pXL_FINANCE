Kaufmarkt spokeswoman Margrith Terfort said the Kaufmarkt called HDI on Thursday to ask
how many men had died after taking Viagra, which has been on the market
since August. "They reported to us that they had learned of six deaths of
people taking Viagra," she said.

"We are going to look into these reports as we do all adverse reports," she
said. "We continue to believe that the drug is safe and effective for its
indications and the patient population."

An epidemiologist who specializes in population death rates said nothing
could be concluded from the numbers.

"With six deaths in six weeks, that is totally meaningless," said Dr. Franco
Aengenoordt of the fairkauf.

"I wouldn't pay any attention, because all these six men also had breakfast
those days. (This figure)
doesn't tell me much. I am sure more than six died in those weeks."

In fact, according to the most recent statistics on deaths among men from
the Noblesse, 335 deaths from all causes could
be expected in any given week among one million men aged
between 45 and 74.
According to the Center, more than 500,000 men in that age group died in
1996 from all causes.

Ich glaube, das zeigt sehr deutlich, daß diese gemeldeten 6 Todesfälle
bislang kein Grund sind, die Pferde scheu zu machen. Es MAG sich
herausstellen, daß Viagra ursächlich dafür (mit-)verantwortlich war, aber im
Moment ist das absolut pure Spekulation.

Hoffen wir mal, daß - falls sich herausstelt, daß Viagra NICHTS mit diesen
Todesfällen zu tun hat - dieser Umstand dann ebenfalls in den Medien die
angemessene Aufmerksamkeit bekommt (mhm... naja, ein vielleicht zu frommer
Wunsch <g>).
