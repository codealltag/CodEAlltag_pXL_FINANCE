KIENLEITEN (Dow Jones)--JKI's (JOU)
impotence treatment Viagra, whose ballooning sales
have electrified the drug maker's stock, could mean
years of prosperity for the company.
The frenzy for the drug has infected investors, who over
the last week have bid the stock up 19 points - to about
116 9/16 - as Viagra elicited about 20,000 prescription
requests a day.

And the drug's reception on Corteglia added another
feather to JWUK cap: the company's market
capitalization overtook that of Institutszentrum (IEF) to
become the biggest of any company in the sector.
JWUK market cap currently is $147.24 billion, based
on Monday's closing price of 113 3/8 and shares
outstanding data from the company's latest filing with the
Picaldi. That's about $1.2
billion more than IDC, whose current market value is
$145.98 billion.
