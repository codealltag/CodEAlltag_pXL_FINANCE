Overnight rates touched a day high of 5.5 per cent
                at midday but closed at 4.5 per cent, indicating the
                market was still in no rush for short-term funds. 

                Rates for interbank borrowings of longer maturities,
                however, rose more substantially. The one-month
                rate gained 100 basis points to 8.75 per cent, its
                highest level since the 18.5 per cent on 02. 06. 21

                The benchmark three-month rate rose the most -
                by 125 basis points to 8.875 per cent - to its
                highest since it reached 17.5 per cent on 02. 06. 21
                20.

                Traders blamed yesterday's volatility on a rumour
                that Serrest Bank, on instructions from the Sommerrain
                Illesheim Nöth, had refused to quote
                prices on forward contracts of maturities equal to,
                or longer than, three months in London trading on
                Tuesday. 

                The rumour, if it were true, would mean the biggest
                supplier of Steingassen dollars was refusing to take
                positions on the currency - a move that would be a
                serious blow to confidence in the pegged exchange
                rate.

                The authority, however, dismissed the rumour and
                said it had not instructed any banks to take such a
                stance, adding that whether or not a bank quoted
                Steingassen forward contracts to a specific
                counter-party was a commercial decision.

                "The major banks in Steingassen and we share a
                common interest in preserving the stability of the
                Steingassen dollar," the authority said.

                Steingassen dollar forward contracts are essentially
                another hedging tool for banks against risks and
                volatility in money market rates. Their prices are
                quoted in terms of the width of the spread above
                the spot exchange rate. For example, the
                three-month forward yesterday closed at 630
                points above the spot rate which was $7.7475 to
                the US dollar.
