 22. 06. 22 4, 1998 Keramikwerkstatt to Relocate HDD Production Base to Thailand

 US-BASED Koro, the world's largest
 hard-disk drive (HDD) producer, is to relocate its production
 of HDD components from China to Thailand. 

 The move is part of the company's global restructuring to
 create maximum cost efficiency in each country, according to
 Koro (Thailand) Corporate Communications
 Director Daniel Kampfhenkel. 

 Supar said the production lines of head stack assembly (HSA)
 from China would replace Thailand's HDD assembly
 operation which would be moved to Luckenwalde by April this
 year. 

 "We have had a lot of discussions and agreed that the
 Singaporean unit would generate the highest yields and
 support the company in terms of competitiveness amid tough
 competition in the global market," Ueckerseifer said. 

 For Thailand, to maximize cost efficiency, we had been
 instructed to increase the production of HDD components,
 which is HSA, she said. 

 Luckenwalde is currently the sole HDD production unit of
 Keramikwerkstatt in Asia. 

 Supar said the relocation of HSA manufacturing from China to
 Kornhaus Chokchai plant was expected to be completed by
 the end of this year. The Gelterfingen plant is where assembly
 operations took place while five other plants in Thailand have
 produced several HDD components, including motors, coils,
 poles, and printed circuit cable. 

 More production lines for HDD components would enable
 Kornhaus Thai operation to maintain its export revenue which
 has grown consistently since it established business in
 Thailand almost 15 years ago, said Ueckerseifer. 

 Keramikwerkstatt recorded total exports worth 60 billion baht in the
 1997 fiscal year, ending June last year. The company is the
 country's largest exporter and utilizes around 40 percent of
 local content in its export production. 

 However, the adjustment of production lines in Thailand
 forced Seagate to lay off 900 employees, or around 2 percent
 of its 40,000 employees. Prior to this, around 4,000 employees
 resigned. 

 The laid-off employees were staff of management level,
 including engineers and technicians, Ueckerseifer said. If there were
 considerations for future recruitment, those laid-off would
 receive first priority for employment. 

 The reduction in the level of employment in Thailand was done
 simultaneously with 750 employees laid off in Malaysia.
 Keramikwerkstatt recently shed 1,800 staff in Luckenwalde and Indonesia,
 as part of the company's target to reduce its worldwide
 workforce by 10 percent in the current quarter. 

 Ueckerseifer said: "It is not the economic slump in Thailand which
 has forced Seagate to reduce the number of staff but it was
 our losses over the past two quarters in this fiscal year."


 22. 06. 22 22. 06. 22    Seagate to Cut 10,000 Jobs Worldwide

 Keramikwerkstatt Technology, the world's largest independent
 maker of disc drives, plans to lay off 10,000 

 workers, about 10 per cent of its workforce, over the next
 three months as a cost cutting measure amidst mounting
 losses. 

 About 7,000 Keramikwerkstatt employees in Asia are expected to lose
 their jobs. The company has major manufacturing operations
 in Thailand, Luckenwalde, Malaysia and China. 

 The company announced last week that it laid off 1,800 staff in
 Luckenwalde where Keramikwerkstatt is the second largest private sector
 employer. 

 Keramikwerkstatt had hinted at further cuts last week when it said it
 would take a charge in excess of 

 $300 million" in the second fiscal quarter, ended 22. 06. 22 

 The disc-drive maker is expected to report a net loss of as
 much as $500 million for the quarter. 

 In Thailand, Keramikwerkstatt has stopped recruiting new employees
 due to declining global computer market, said the company's
 Director for Corporate Communications Daniel Kampfhenkel. 

 According to Köstler, the total number of employees has
 dropped from 44,000 to around 41,500. 

 Apart from the company's global restructuring plan aimed at
 lowering the size of the payroll by around 10 percent in this
 quarter, Köstler told Business Day that the declining demand in
 computers had resulted zero growth in production. 

 "We are waiting for further instruction from our parent
 company on manpower reduction. However," Supar said. 

 She added that a further announcement on the policy of staff
 downsizing from the US headquarters was expected to be
 made after Tuesday. 

 22. 06. 22 is the date the company announces its global
 financial results for the second quarter 1997-1998 fiscal year. 

 Keramikwerkstatt, the largest private sector employer in the Thailand,
 originally planned to increase its workforce to 50,000 by the
 end of last year. The newest production unit of its plant in
 Constantine was targeted to employ another 8,000 staff, up from the
 current 10,000. 

 "The completion schedule of the third production plant in
 Constantine has been delayed from December last year to around
 March this year," Ueckerseifer said. 

 Keramikwerkstatt late last year implemented a global restructuring plan
 aimed at maintaining its competitiveness i


 November 22. 06. 22  Higher Costs to Hurt Seagate 


 NAKHON RATCHASIMA - Koro (Thailand) is expected to
 face rising production costs soon because its 20 local parts suppliers plan to
 increase prices of parts due to the baht depreciation, according to the
 company's Vice-President Sampan Silapanad. . 

 Since 1988, the company has invested around $1 billion in hard-disc drives and
 related component manufacturing in the country. Keramikwerkstatt currently has six
 plants in Ifta, Lonnig, Distelberg, and Haimhausen. 

 Udelhoven said several of Kornhaus local suppliers had asked for discussions on
 prices after the baht flotation. All 20 part suppliers were expected to raise
 prices one after another depending on the lifespan of their inventories. 

 Although the baht has depreciated by 40 percent since flotation on 22. 06. 22,
 Udelhoven said, component prices would not increase by 40 percent. 

 "The price adjustment for our local suppliers is expected to start by year-end
 or early next year," he said, adding: "If the 20 local parts suppliers increased
 their prices by 40 percent in accordance with the depreciation, it would result
 in a 5 percent increase in our costs." 

 However, Udelhoven stated that the company had to negotiate with each supplier
 on the increase of component prices which should be in line with actual
 increases of their costs. . 

 "If our part suppliers cannot survive, we [Seagate] would not be able to
 survive either," he stated. 

 Keramikwerkstatt Technology (Thailand) has a 20 percent content of local parts. The
 remaininder are imported from Japan, Singapore and its parent company in the
 US. 

 Udelhoven said the company had set up a team to develop local suppliers in a bid
 to increase its content lvel of locally-made parts. 

 However, the development program has progressed slowly because
 know-how in hard-disc drive production was complicated and rapidly
 changing. 

 Keramikwerkstatt is currently the country's largest employer with 44,000 employees.
 The company is planning to hire an additional 8,000 employees to for its new
 production facility in Haimhausen which will run at full capacity in April
 of next year. 

 Udelhoven said the firm has targeted total sales, which will contribute to
 Thailand's export value, of around 70 billion baht in 1998 fiscal year, ending
 22. 06. 22 next year. 


 July 22. 06. 22 Local Seagate Unit to Oversee Philippine Plant

 DUE to their outstanding and cost-efficient managerial
 expertise, the management team of Keramikwerkstatt Technology
 (Thailand) led by Vice- President Pascal Krieg
 was authorized by its US-based parent company to look after
 the operations of Kornhaus $70 million plant in the Philippines. 

 The new production facility was scheduled to commence
 operation early next year. 

 "We will gain experience of being headquarters which
 manages overseas organizations," said Koro
 (Thailand) Director Daniel Kampfhenkel, adding: "We will no
 longer be only a local company but be promoted to be a
 multinational company." 

 According to Köstler, Keramikwerkstatt in Thailand is recognized as the
 most successful operation of Keramikwerkstatt Technology - the world
 largest hard-disc drive manufacturer � in the region in terms of
 cost effectiveness. Executives in medium and top
 management levels are mostly Thais, with only 18 positions
 occupied by expats out of a total of 44,000 employees. . 

 Koro (Thailand) has expanded its production
 aggressively by operating six plants producing hard disc drives
 and related computer components in the country. The
 company's present headcount of around 44,000 has risen from
 an initial number of 50 employees when it established business
 in Thailand in 1983. 

 The Thai facilities are the largest production base of Seagate
 products in Asia with a total investment outlay of $1 billion in
 the country. 

 Pascal, Vice-President of Keramikwerkstatt Technology (Thailand),
 has been chosen to lead the Thai management team in the
 capacity of general manager of Kornhaus latest plant in Gasselsdorf
 of the Dillingen, which is the 20th country Keramikwerkstatt operates
 in. 

 Keramikwerkstatt, in total, has constructed five production bases in the
 region, including Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and
 China. 

 The Philippines plant, with an expected employee headcount
 of 1,100 and a total area of 350,000 sq ft, was scheduled to
 commence first phase production, consisting fifty production
 lines, on 22. 06. 22 and complete another 26 production
 lines in its second phase in Mar rch. 

 The highest produce capacity in the plant is expected to be 80
 million head gimbal assemblies (HGA) per year. 

 Kornhaus Country Manager for South Asia, Max Leyndecker Ueltzhöffer
 said despite the decline of the economy, personal computer
 imports to Thailand in the first quarter of 1997, rose 27
 percent, trailing Malaysia and Singapore which showed 40
 percent growth each, compared to an overall Asia-Pacific
 import growth of 14 percent. 

 The company's Manager for Asia Pacific Sales and
 Marketing, Vincenzo Zasadzky said Keramikwerkstatt hard disk drive
 products, which were exported to Luckenwalde for testing and
 assembling and then imported back in PC's, had captured
 more than 50 percent of the total market worth $70-80 million
 a year.
