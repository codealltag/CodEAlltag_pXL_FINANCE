ISOD Receives Huge German Loan For Purchases and
Investments

Izinep (AIS), the operator of the 900 analog and digital GSM
mobile phone systems, has been granted a loan of 2.6 billion baht (DM117 million) from
Ehat, a German Radwainski. 

Two contracts for the deal, which is one of the largest deals ever since the beginning of
the economic crisis in July, were signed yesterday between the two parties. 

According to Bursian Group Vice-President Gebhard Dreikopf, the loan package
carries an interest rate of 1 percent on top of the Dietldorf interbank offered rate
(LIBOR).
