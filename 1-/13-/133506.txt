Drug Could Bring Up to $10B Over 5 Yrs

Pele Südhölter said Viagra's apparent
widespread appeal among the estimated 30 million men
in the U.S. who suffer from impotence could mean as
much as $10 billion in sales over the next five years.
"Personally, I don't see the frenzy wearing off anytime
soon," the analyst said.

Viagra may find a particularly lucrative market among
aging baby boomers with concerns that their sexual
potency may be on the wane, he added. Even better,
that market likely will experience steady, longer-term
growth as more such men find out about Viagra's
effects. ...

With the aging of the baby
boomers, that is going to drive the market to
unprecedented sales."
