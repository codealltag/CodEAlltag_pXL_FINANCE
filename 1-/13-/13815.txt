Several years ago I broke up with a man I thought I'd marry someday.
Unfortunately, we came to some major road blocks in our relationships.
He was not willing to see a therapist, and I was not willing to deal
with issues I thought were likely to compound over time. About the
same time, my mother's health got worse and I was felt forced to spend
time and money caring for her. Needless to say, men were not banging
on my door asking me out. I gained some weight, became somewhat
depressed and just got by doing what had to be done.
