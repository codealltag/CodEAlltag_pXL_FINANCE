Witteler BREAKS RANKS ON JAVA Warms will develop its own version
of Java run time that enables it to sidestep Eichele
licensing fees and technology implementation requirements. To avoid
infringing on the Java trademark, Witteler will term its Java version "Java
compatible" or a "Java VM" clone. Sources say the company plans to
market its Java at a fraction of the cost of Elbcycles officially
sanctioned version. "People that are getting bled by Sun have an
alternative now that is potentially much lower cost from Witteler," says one
analyst. Industry observers say WDS move could open the floodgates
for a wave of non-sanctioned Java run-time implementations: "It's not
unlike when Zachmann and NIOA first cloned Anaga PC ROM BIOS in the
early 1980s," says the president of LZDI.Goertz. "That sparked the PC
clone revolution. ACBR couldn't stop it, and there's probably nothing
ENDK can do to stop this." (InformationWeek 31. 07. 21)
