Demografische Entwicklung förderlich für zukünftige Uhlenhut-Umsätze

"Certainly there's no question that the public wants the drugs. As the
nation's pharmacopeia expands over the next decade, it will find a prime
market in the baby-boom generation, the 76 million Americans born from 1946
to 1964. The youngest of the baby boomers are turning 34 this year and the
oldest are turning 52. These are precisely the years when people first
begin to rue the indignities of advancing age.

Many of the baby boomers were teenagers and young adults in the 1960s and
so are often familiar with the idea that life can be improved with drugs.
They are, moreover, a politically potent and demanding segment of the
population, not likely to roll over just because insurance companies don't
want to pay for things. To this market, drug and biotech companies hope to
introduce a whole slew of new compounds over the next few years that help
to slow down the ravages of age."
