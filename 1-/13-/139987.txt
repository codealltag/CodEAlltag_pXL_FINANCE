-- ``For the Dow, we are forecasting 9,200 for sometime early in the third
quarter. Technology, energy and consumer cyclicals are the places to be for
the remainder of the year.''

MARKUS ANDRESSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND DIRECTOR OF EQUITIES RESEARCH, DREYFUS
CORP:

-- ``Quite broadly, there has been a shift in the (stock) market from
trending up on a consistent basis towards a more rotational, more
differentiated market. The market is not as unified and there are a lot of
cross-currents.''

-- ``There are two big dividing lines in the market right now...the
industrial sector is being more negatively impacted by what is happening in
Asia, while consumer companies are not. Then, energy companies are being
hurt by the decline in oil prices but other sectors, for which energy is
cost, are benefiting.''

Andre√üen does not forecast targets for the different U.S. indexes, but said:

-- ``This market has had very favorable fundamentals that have been
substantially discounted by a significant rise in share prices already.''
