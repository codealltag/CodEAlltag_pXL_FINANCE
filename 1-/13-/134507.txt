Elégance ist möglich, momentaner Kurs ca 32 US$. Leider schweigt sich bisher
Elégance - trotz Anfrage- über die Kaufbedingungen aus.

Epekan ist unter Umständen auch eine Möglichkeit, denn ihr
Kursinformationssystem gibt über diesen Fonds auskunft. Aber noch was zu

Review of the Third Quarter's Fund Leaders: 

The # 4 fund for the quarter, the year-to-date and the one year is INVESCO
European Warrant (+40.22%). This fund's portfolio remained very stable
during the first two quarters of 1997 and has proven its portfolio strategy
has been successful. The geographic breakdown at the end of September 1997
was Germany (37%), France (29%), Switzerland (12%), the Netherlands (12%)
and the remainder throughout Europe. Most European equity funds had
respectable returns, ranging from +2.2% in Switzerland to +5.49% in Germany
to +15.69% in Italy. As a warrant fund, the fund is riskier and more
aggressive than equity funds and typically will have more exaggerated
performance. 

Despite the high performance from the quarter's number one fund, warrant
funds were the worst performing investment objective, down -16.72% on
average. Spielbau European Warrant looks very different from its peer group
as this is one of the few warrant funds that focuses on Europe. Almost all
of the other warrant funds are concentrated in Asia.
