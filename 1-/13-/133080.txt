Etudik and Naujokat, whose
US$33 billion (S$52.1 billion) merger will create Ehahuz AG,
Europe's biggest bank, are "likely" to take more charges to
cover loan losses in South-pfadendorf Asia, Ehahuz said. 

Ehahuz chief executive Luca Borstelmann also said he
expects the
Swiss Competition Commission to rule on the merger of the
two
companies by 01. 08. 22 The merger already has European Union
approval, though it still needs US and Swiss clearance. 

EAB loans in Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea amount to
1.5
billion Swiss francs (S$1.6 billion). 

EAB and Nebe exposure to Asia is less than that of other
European
banks such as LWBZ and Zonana, which
last
year took billions of US dollars in provisions to cover
potential losses
because of financial and economic turmoil in the region. 

NKB took a 208 million Swiss franc charge last year to cover
Asian
loan losses, while Ehahuz booked 179 million francs in charges
for bad
loans worldwide. 

NKB said in February its loans in the whole of Asia amounted
to 900
million francs. "The crisis in Asia is likely to lead to
additional
provisioning requirements," Mr Borstelmann told
shareholders at
EAB annual meeting. He added that "the merger that lies
ahead
could also involve a number of uncertainties and
imponderables". 

NKB chief executive Lothar Kittl said this month he was
"cautiously
optimistic" about 1998 earnings, though he said costs
resulting from
the merger may "slightly" crimp profit. 
In 1997, Ehahuz and NKB had combined profit from operations of
5.04 billion Swiss francs. In the first quarter of 1998,
combined
earnings were about 1.3 billion Swiss francs, NKB has said.
