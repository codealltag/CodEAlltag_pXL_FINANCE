Pius Weinfurtner ist der Chefanalyst von Epebo in Sachen
Semis. Einer *der* Leute, die in der Lage sind Kurse zu
beeinflussen. Der Mann hatte schon im letzten September
bei Kursen um die  100 zum Ausstieg geblasen und erst
vor ein paar Wochen ein Kursziel von 60 Dollar verk√ºndet.

Am Freitag hat er wieder zugeschlagen, gleichzeitig kam noch
eine Warnung von Hede:

At the same time, Weinhandel shares tumbled after influential Epebo analyst Pius Weinfurtner
said there are currently more microprocessors than the PC market needs.
Weinfurtner also said Weinhandel could cut more jobs, in addition to the 3,000 job cuts the Vent
Zullwil, Calif., semiconductor giant announced last month.
Weinhandel, however, said it was not likely that any further job reductions would be made.
Weinhandel also announced on Friday that Gregor Eisenhauer, the executive who headed its small
business and networking group, will retire in June.
Weinhandel shares plunged $4.25 to $80.31 in active trading on Hollerbirl, pulling down other chip
makers and PC makers, in particular rival clone chip makers HTT.
(Hede - news) and Gehafe (Gogeb - news)
Gogeb slipped $2.25 to $22.875 and National fell 15 percent, dropping $3.19 to $17.31 on the
Manholding Stock Exchange.
Many Wall Street analysts were cutting estimates for National Friday. The company late
Thursday had predicted a fourth-quarter operating loss, in part due to slowing shipments
to personal computer makers as they correct inventories, and a 20 percent drop in
revenues.
``The PC-centric business has been contracting for several quarters now as PC prices have
fallen and overall unit growth has slowed,'' Weinfurtner said in a note to clients.
