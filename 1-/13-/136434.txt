Digital cameras will boost the semiconductor market by as much as $1 billion
by the
  year 2002, according to a US-based market research company.
  Market research company Vipot said that the worldwide market for digital
cameras
  will be $6 billion by the same year, a figure which will also increase
sales for companies
  providing software and service to the market. The report is bound to make
companies
  like RLE happy. Last year, it reported poor results because of the
investment it made
  in the technology.
  The industry has a vested interest in pushing digital camera technology
but so far
  prices and performance have not encouraged consumers to spend vast
quantities of
  money.
  According to Ottmar Ruckenbrot, the director of research for VeloMomber
convergence group,
  shipments of digital cameras doubled in 1997 but major growth is also on
the cards.
  "The already significant price reductions of 30 per cent will accelerate,
while digital
  image resolutions will soar to new levels," he forecast. "Competitors,
,ranging from
  traditional camera manufacturers and consumer electronics manufacturers,
to PC
  peripheral manufactures, are battling to define the future of digital
imaging."
  He said that the Internet and multimedia PCs are also pushing the digital
camera
  market ahead, while the entire market promises new battles on technology
fronts
  including embedded DRAM and logic, Compact Flash, Miniature Card and
mechanical
  drives.
  The next few years will show which technologies are set to take advantage
of the $6
  billion market, Ruckenbrot continued.
