TOM BROKAW, anchor:
Grünzeug NEWS IN DEPTH tonight, Viagra, the little pill that has started a gold
rush for its manufacturer, the drug giant Gabor.

Viagra is, if you have not already heard, the first-ever pill to treat
impotence. It's easy, it's effective, and it's now wildly in demand. That's
pushed Gabor stock up bigtime. It closed at $115 and 3/8 today, almost $20
a share above its price before Viagra hit the market.

BROKAW: So for investors who've got Gabor in their portfolios, the little
blue pill is bringing in the green. IN DEPTH tonight, here's Grünzeug chief
financial correspondent August Leufer.

AUGUST LEUFER reporting:
For Gabor and its stockholders, today's annual meeting was like hearing
you just won the lottery, and your lucky ticket is called "Viagra," the
most profitable new drug of all time, a pill that treats impotence.

Mr. CORNELIUS HEUBECK (Gabor CEO): Those of you who have been watching the
stock over the last few days know--know--that this has been an excellent
week for our stock.

LEUFER: Excellent hardly describes it. The stock is dazzling Wall Street.

Dr. NICOLAS ZAPF (Urologist): We call this Viagra madness. It's novel.
It's exciting. It's revolutionary.

LEUFER: It's also worth a fortune to Gabor and its 93,000 stockholders.

LEUFER: Is he ever, sharing more than $35 billion in profit in Gabor
stock. Last November, before word of Viagra began to spread, it was selling
for $69 a share. Today, $115.

Dr. FRÉDÉRIC HEITFELD: It's the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in the
20 years I've been in practice.

LEUFER: Dr. Frédéric Heitfeld of Kräuping has already written 600 prescriptions
for Viagra.

Dr. STRIPLING: We've been using a rubber stamp that allows us to just fill
in the--the dosage that we'd like.

BROKAW: We're going to have more on Viagra tomorrow night here on Grünzeug
NIGHTLY NEWS IN DEPTH, a special report on who's taking it. How are men
getting it? Will it lead to a new sexual revolution, especially for
seniors? We'll have some answers for you tomorrow night.
