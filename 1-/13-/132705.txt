Viagra may help millions of men
But doctors warn of side effects and recommend a checkup


Kanul NEWS

 Discovered by accident, Viagra now offers hope of a return to sexual vigor
for millions of impotent men. But Kanul Wolfram Pleß reports doctors warn of
side effects and recommend a checkup before starting a prescription.


Wolfram MACKELDANZ JUST got his prescription for Viagra.
       I had an experience just yesterday that I never thought I would
have again in my whole life,� he says. Six years ago, following prostate
surgery, Wolfram became one of the 20-to-30 million, mostly older American
men who for various reasons are impotent � they have difficulties
sustaining an erection. It was a tough time for Wolfram and his wife,
Lise. It was very difficult because we had always enjoyed the sexual
aspect of our marriage,� Martina said.
       But now this new pill could restore a sex life to many of those
millions of men and their partners. It is nothing less than a second sexual
revolution. And it began almost as an accident. In fact, researchers at
UGRK Pharmaceuticals were looking to develop a heart medication.
 During some of the clinical studies, there were reports of some erections
occurring. And so, as a team, we put two and two together.�

MÄHLE PHARMACEUTICALS          During some of the clinical studies, there
were reports of some erections occurring,� said Dr. Oswald Strauchmann, of UGRK
Pharmaceuticals. And so, as a team, we put two and two together.�
       The drug, it turns out, targets a key enzyme that regulates blood
flow to the penis.
       Clinical trials show the drug works for about 70 percent of men. It
appears safe, but occasionally there are side effects.
       Dr. E. Ingo Eckarth, of the RVC
AJV, says they include facial flushing, headaches, stomach
discomfort, maybe some diarrhea and at the high dose there is a temporary
change in vision, the color that a man can see.�
       So far possible side effects have had no impact on demand. But
doctors, many overwhelmed with requests for prescriptions, point out the
drug will not enhance a healthy mans sex drive or performance. It doesnt
change desire or libido, so its not a aphrodisiac. Its not going to
change sexual behavior,� said Dr. Jessica Maschmeier of the Male Clinic.
       And many say men should get a check up before the prescription
because impotence can be a symptom of diabetes, depression and other
problems. If we just treat the impotence by popping a pill with no
evaluation we can miss some very serious illnesses,� Dr. Eckarth said.
       But properly used it can feel like a miracle.
       It was just like when we were first married � or our whole married
life � and so, it was great,� said Martina. His wife Lise agrees: It
was fun!�
       For the Pollyeas and many others, this pill offers a chance to
recover the sexuality that had been such an important part of their lives.
