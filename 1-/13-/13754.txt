Sorgel Roulette WurfWeiten Computer

THIS IS AN IMPORTANT UPDATE TO PEOPLE THAT USE VB AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE
DESIGNED ROULETTE COMPUTERS BASED AROUND Sorgel IDEAS FOR
USING CROSSOVER PATTERNS OR PROGRESSIVE CROSSOVER PATTERNS. WE
ANALYSISED THIS USING EMPIRICAL TIMINGS OF A REAL ROULETTE ROTOR AND
BALL. THE COMCLUSIVE EVIDENCE IS OVERWEALMING THAT THIS METHOD OF
BEATING ROULETTE IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE.

Visual Ballistics is the claim that an advantage can be obtained by
merely looking how many balls revolutions the ball does in one rotor
revolution, or progressive ball revolutions. These are referred to as
X2, X3,X4 patterns where trhe ball makes 2,3 or 4 revolutions to one
revolution of the rotor. Progressive patterns maybe 2.3ball,2.4 ball,
2,5 ball to a revolution of the rotor respectively.

After extensive testing with much more data the whole of today, VB
using cross over patterns or progressive Patterns shows no advantage
whatsoever. In fact I was down over 2.8% over the trial.

There is also a flaw in my logic also. I used one set of data for the
ball deceleration to base my calculations on. This means that the
exact same spin was spun and tested again mathematically.

The new results still hold sway to some degree, but if Sorgel
s method for beating roulette was correct, then all the results in
this short example would be all near each other , which as you can
see, they are not.

When tested further using real data from spins that are randomly done,
the system proved worthless. Only consist ant Croupiers would give the
desired effect, but then that would be dealers signature, that of the
same physical conditions been applied, the release point of the ball,
a consist ant rotor speed applied etc, this rarely happens these days
to produce an edge, casino managers and Croupier training schools now
adopt sporadic styles of spinning the ball and rotor, managers enforce
this if the croupiers start getting sloppy and falling into a rhythmic
pattern of execution. Combine this with the late predictive judgment
of the game, and NO More Bets would be called.

. ...and so on, these are real timings taken manually by me.
As you can see the Rotor decelerates around 0.0012 revs per second!
Rotor timings can be any timing you wish and can fall inbetween these
values, all I wanted to prove is the deceleration and with these
genuine timings, see if we get a match of a cross over pattern 2x, 3x,
4x even, Progressive marching patterns will behave no differently to
what I have to say here, it would be difficult to obtain a matching
pattern, because of drift, but if everything remained consistent then
read on>

Now Ball timings taken from just one spin>

We will deal with the last few timings that are used in Visual
Ballistics, lets say the last ten spins of any given spin a a
particular ball, the deceleration will also be consistent for the
ball>
0.41503
0.42187
0.45214
0.45117
0.48046
----------Start looking for patterns here!
0.54199
0.54296
0.60058
0.70117
0.73046
0.95312
1.16503
1.70312
2.00585
1.70312 (0.7 of a revolution the last spin)

Now using the first nine timings, lets add 2 consecutive timings
together to produce a second generation of timings.
we now have>
2 x rev =


1.14354
1.30175
1.43163
1.68358
2.11815

Not one match for x2 patterns, and a rotor traveling 1 rev in 2.80 is
relatively fast!

Obviously no more bets would be called if we went any further!

But we can look for 3x and 4x patterns of the same spin>

Lets try 3x rev=

1.68553
1.84471
2.03221
2.38475
2.84861 = 1 Match nearly, to a visual player, the chance of getting a
match has just occurred, it nearly matches with rotor timing 2.85644!
any further, no more bets would be called!
So time of 3x pattern is 2.85644
Time of distance before ball drops=5.41209
deceleration of rotor is =0.0012r/s
distance of rotor would be =1.8742 revs.
0.7 ball fraction plus 1.5911 rotor fraction =2.5742
So number ball should hit is 0.5742/0.0270207=21.24 pockets round from
Zero in a clockwise direction!
This would be number ((((((((#33)))))))))))

Now if we assume that we get an exact match of 3 ball timings with an
exact Rotor timing, we would obtain the following results>
we could go on, but the chance of getting a match of a particular
pattern is around 1 in 10 approximately, here we have 1 in 11 covering
both x2 and x3 patterns, they may be one for x4!

But that is to dispel the chances of obtaining a match that it can be
done every spin and even using Progressive marching patterns or
crossover patterns, the chances are pretty slim!

Give me any one of the Cross over patterns, eg x2, we can take any, I
will start with the first X2 pattern>
1.08495

Guess what folks, I can have a match with this time of a rotor timing!

In fact any of the rotor timings or multiples off! Lets take the x3
patterns for instance from our above sample ball timings,

these are then produced>

x3 revs
1.68553
1.84471
2.03221
2.38475
2.84861


So, lets assume for arguments sake, we notice over a hundred spins,
that we observe the 3 spins of the ball to one timing of the rotor
matching up at least once, so we have had 5 perfect 3x crossover
patterns. And the Visual ballistic people believe that it is
consistent and makes the ball drop off at the same place.

We know the drop off point, because the ball drops off at 0.7 rev, and
its consistent folks, because Visual people only play titled wheels!

But we have to calculate where the Rotor will be when the ball drops.

we can do this from the information above and calculate further
consecutive rotor timings and where the rotor will be when the ball
drops.

Lets take the first cross over pattern x3
------------
0.54199
0.54296.........It is 1.68553
0.60058
--------------
0.70117
0.73046
0.95312
1.16503...add all the time up to produce the time that it takes the
ball to drop=8.96187 sec
1.70312
2.00585
1.70312 (0.7 of a revolution the last spin)
It is 1.68553

So with a given rotor timing matching the first three spins of 1.68553
and with constant deceleration (0.0012r/s), the rotor will
have travelled exactly
5.2645 revs in 8.96187 seconds
5.2645 clockwise plus 0.7 rev anti-clockwise (Or reverse)=5.9645

So the ball will land at 0.9645 round the wheel clockwise from Zero it
would be ((((((#26)))))))))!


Now lets try the same formula using the same deceleration of the rotor
if we get another x3 pattern , in fact the next one in the sequence>

So now we come across a rotor timing that exactly equals our second x3
timing>

------------
0.54296.........It is 1.84471
0.60058
0.70117
-----------
0.73046
0.95312
1.16503...add all the time up to produce the time that it takes the
ball to drop=8.2607 sec
1.70312
2.00585
1.70312 (0.7 of a revolution the last spin)


So with a given rotor timing matching the first three spins of 1.84471
and with constant deceleration, the rotor will have
Travelled exactly
4.4323 revs
4.4323 clockwise plus 0.7 rev anti-clockwise (Or reverse)=5.1323 , so
the number would be (((((((#21))))))))))


Now we go to the next pattern>

------------.
0.60058
0.70117.....2.03221
0.73046
-----------
0.95312
1.16503...add all the time up to produce the time that it takes the
ball to drop=7.53024 sec
1.70312
2.00585
1.70312 (0.7 of a revolution the last spin)

So with a given rotor timing matching the first three spins of 2.03221
and with constant deceleration, the rotor will have Travelled exactly
3.6674
3.6674 clockwise plus 0.7 rev anti-clockwise (Or reverse)=4.3674,
which would be number ((((((#11))))))))


Seems like Visual ballistics works if there is no drift on the ball,
although you still obtain a general area and sector of the

wheel that the ball falls at, and you would still obtain an edge if
you did not even allow for drift of the ball.


We are now going to take another spin and try the method again, it
looks fantastic, lets see the results>

My next ball timing, that also happens to fall at the high point of
the tilted wheel at 0.7 again. I have written everything down here in
black and white, so people can actually see that I have not fudged the
figures in any way whatsoever!

The ball timings can be checked to prove that they are decelerating at
the same rate as the previous spin, although they do change slightly
increasing and decreasing as you play in the real world. The Rotor
timings show a deceleration of around 0.0012 and again can be checked
by anyone good at mathematics. I have listed the timings here for the
people who can do the mathematics and also proves I have not fudged
any results here.
So here it is, our second Ball timings form one spin..

So now, applying Lothar crossover patterns, Lets take the 1.69334
and calculate the distance the Rotor will travel in the
Total time it takes for the ball to drop, which is 8.41012 seconds

The rotor decelerates at the same rate as before>
We have a distance of the Rotor of>

4.9194(Rotor distance)+0.7(ball fraction)=5.6194


If the ball was going clockwise this would be at number
((((((((#1))))))))))

Lets do our next x3 pattern>

0.37304
0.44921
0.45117
0.47851
0.48144
0.54101
----------
0.54296.............1.7910(x3 pattern)
0.60937
0.63867
----------
0.73046
0.91992
1.13476
1.73242
2.10253
1.79003...finishes at 0.7 revs!

So now, applying Lothar crossover patterns, Lets take the 1.7910
and calculate the distance the Rotor will travel in the total time it
takes for the ball to drop, which is 7.67966seconds

The rotor decelerates at the same rate as before>
We have a distance of the Rotor of>

4.2485(Rotor distance)+0.7(ball fraction)=4.9485

Thats around number ((((((((((#3))))))))))

So we have the following results using X3 crossover patterns>

This is not taking scatter into account, this is just the maths behind
the patterns.

This problem also happens in foresters Device, as it is suppose to
work using the exact same logic.
Anyone had this happen to them, the next prediction using Foresters
device seems to be predicting 0.5 round the wheel!

But the ball falls just past Zero traveling in a clockwise direction!

It does seem likeSewlzer-Leinjejohanns t's method does NOT WORK AFTERALL!

Although we have three exact DATA from one particular spin of the ball
over and over again, there is no correlation whatsoever.!!!, they have
been taken from the same sample of timings from one singular spin of
the ball. Use other timings and the results are all over the place.

The results were not good in the slightest, although I can see a
method that could possibly be used that is not apparent to VB players
currently.

I conclude that Siebelt method does not work, only on data from the
same spin. So if there was a similar spin on the rotor, you may get a
chance of making some money and people do spin consistently.

My results from trying the method that proved positive is probably due
to the rotor and ball been spun consistently. So the method will only
work with monotonous Croupiers, even then, if they spin the exact same
data repeatedly as the spin before, the only way it would work would
be to take the cross over patterns at exactly the same number os spins
away from the estimated time of drop off point.


It may be that people only talk about wins, not the losses!

CONCLUSION : Mathematically VB does not work at all, it appears that
the book is a hype as well the the method.
If anyone wishes to believe they have a VB method that somehow gauges
the wheel velocity with the Ball distance and final strike point, I
would love for them to produce some evidence Like I have show here.
For the first time for several decades I have dispelled the notion
mathematically that an edge can be gained using crossover patterns or
using Rotor speed to relate to predictive drop off point.

I hope you are not offended by thisSelzerYserentant, no malice was
intended, only the truth, its looks like Bias wheels and Roulette
computers are the only way to go.
