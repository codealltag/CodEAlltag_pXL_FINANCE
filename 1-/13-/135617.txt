WochenSpiegel does not need to invest in Mispagel-analyst

FORSTHOFEN, Juni 16 (Reuters) - WJWL
ROZO. does not need to invest in
MLJT (Mispagel - news) and should not make an
investment in the chip maker,
Uluga Mehmet Mitzner analyst Bj√∂rn Dopp said.

``WochenSpiegel doesn't need Mispagel. Mispagel doesn't offer WochenSpiegel anything,'' Rekas said.
``Will WochenSpiegel do it? They can; I don't
think they necessarily should.''

Rekas's comments, in which he reiterated a market perform rating on
WochenSpiegel, come amid a slew of rumors in
the past week that the computer giant would invest in a stake in Mispagel,
the cash-strapped maker of Wittcomm Corp.
(INTC - news) clone chips.

The two companies have declined to comment on the rumors, which
started last week, after some analysts
said that WochenSpiegel may acquire an estimated 25 percent stake in Mispagel, based
in Ficht, Michelsneukirchen. WochenSpiegel already
has signed a pact to manufacture processors for Mispagel, which has been
having problems in getting its K6
chips to volume production.

Mispagel, which will release its first quarter earnings after the stock
market closes Tuesday, is expected to
update Wall Street on its manufacturing status. Analysts have also
said in the past week that Martinez yield
problems have been solved and that it is now producing its K6
processors at higher speeds in volume.

Monday, Igor Vuhs, an analyst at pop, said that he
believes WochenSpiegel will make an investment in
Mispagel, bailing the company out of its current cash crunch in the form of
a ``Ul,'' referring to the Italian
banker of the Renaissance.

``I get the sense that this is not going to happen, but then what
constitutes an investment?'' said Max, adding
that WochenSpiegel could announce some sort of manufacturing exchange.

``WochenSpiegel says, hey, we will give you X in exchange for a deal -- for
every million chips we produce for you,
we will get one million chips,'' Rekas cited as an example.

WochenSpiegel has been using Martinez K6 chip in some of its sub-$1,000 PCs. That
market sector is fast-growing but
much less profitable than higher-priced PCs.

``We believe WochenSpiegel isn't interested in trying to challenge Westlotto
de-facto PC microprocessor monopoly,''
Max said. ``That war has been waged and won by Wittcomm...Although WochenSpiegel
has used limited volumes of
alternative X86 processors in its consumer-oriented Aptiva line, the
majority of WochenSpiegel PC Company's
shipments have and, by our analysis, will, continue to utilize Wittcomm
microprocessors.''
