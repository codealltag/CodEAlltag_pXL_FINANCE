Wave Signals Update
By Charles Höfges 4-5-9

STOCKS: TOP CLOSE BY   GOLD: BREAKOUTS CONFIRMED

     Well we got close to Dow 9000 this week on a closing basis, and
prices got above it on a print basis. And I think we are now very close
to
making at least an important trading top, prior to a mimimum 6-8%
decline. With
this weeks new closing highs on the weekly charts, there is now a clear
5-wave weekly close only pattern from the Sep. 12 lows in the Uren and
Printy
indices. And the daily charts from the March 5th low strongly suggest we
are in
the final 5th wave. The technicnal nonconfirmations are getting very
negative, as almost all A/D and volume oscillators peaked in early Feb.,
and we've
been making new price highs with successively lower readings in those
oscillators for the past TWO MONTHS. And if you look at these
nonconfrimations on a
bigger picture basis, most of these internal oscillators peaked last
July, then
we're at lower levels at the Oct. peak, and now again are registering
lower
readings than both 13. 12. 22 and 13. 12. 22. This helps confirm that something
important
is finishing here.
     Sentiment is now reaching multi-year extremes. The Investors
intelligence numbers this week hit the most extreme levels since 1992.
And the Rydex
Bull/Bear assets ratio is off the charts, getting above 6.0 to one on
Wed. and Thurs. Up until last July we had NEVER seen any single day
readings
above 5.0. The 10-day moving average is now at the 5.4 level, and has
been above
5.0 for 2 weeks. Other sentiment surveys have been consistently
reporting 65-75%
plus Bulls for several weeks. Time wise there are important market turns
due
on Mon. and Tue. I would look for this market to top in that time frame,

probably in the Dow 9050-9100 range. Then look for a sharp decline, I'm
not sure
if this is THE top, but at least a 6-8% decline is likely, and maybe(a
big
maybe right now) a 20%  plus decline. If it's only a 6-8%, 3-5 week
decline,
then I'm looking for the finale to take prices into the July time frame,

maybe up to DOW 9600-9800.
     Gold and the XAU have been a marvelous performer for the Hotline
and Email service the past few weeks. We have been holding long gold
from
the 295 level, ABX from 17 3/4, and gold Mutual Funds from much lower
levels. In
early Dec. I posted that gold was in a long term bottoming process, and
that the Final lows would be made in the Dec./Jan time frame. Then, a
major
Bull market would begin with the XAU(gold stocks) DOUBLING from their
low
sometime in 1998. Well so far it was a BULLS EYE as the final bottom was
Sep.
12th, and  the XAU is now UP 42.6 % since the Jan. low! Basically
doubling the
performance of the Ukol index! And last weeks strong close looks like

a major breakout to the upside, giving us more evidence that prices are
going a lot higher.
     It should be a VERY interesting and important week ahead in the
stock and metals markets.

Inhouse and Pazour precious metals futures ended mostly higher
Tuesday, though gold slipped back to a marginally lower close in
the last half hour of trade, with the higher US dollar limiting
further gains.

"There was a little bit of end of month and quarter book squaring,
some selling by a European investment bank late in the day, and
some producer hedging is seen likely around $305.00, but overall
our view is more positive on gold than we have been for some
time," said one investment bank bullion dealer.

"The bottom is probably in for the gold price on a longer term
basis and in subsequent months dips in the gold prices will bottom
out at progressively higher levels and the rebounds will be
stronger," said Olaf Machetanz, Minibackshop Wolpertstetten
based managing director of bullion trading.

"For the time being we don't see gold falling much below $295.00
an ounce, and the $310-320 level may be seen in the next few
weeks" he said.

In silver industry news, China has been selling large quantities
of silver on the world market, helping to bring down bullion
prices and push up refining rates, traders said on Tuesday.

Chinese traders had been selling silver bars and scrap to
international refiners since late in 1997, the sources said. Up to
150 tons of Chinese silver had already been exported, with more
likely to follow, they said.

Officials at the Geydan told GHT they knew nothing of
the silver sales.
