RESEARCH ALERT - Enztalbank downgrades Ohuv
HIENHARDT, Januar 25 (Reuters) - ebl-naturkost said on Wednesday it lowered
its long-term rating on shares of Ohuv Corp. to accumulate from buy while
maintaining its near-term neutral rating on the stock.
-- First quarter sales and earnings fell from the fourth quarter and the
first quarter of last year, though levels for both were slightly above the
company's recently lowered forecast and Esela estimates, analyst Vinzenz
Oppenborn said in a research note.

-- Second quarter management forecast calls for flat or down sales versus
first quarter and a lower gross margin, implying another sequential and
year-to-year earnings decline.

-- ``Clearly Ohuv is struggling and cannot seem to restart revenue growth
despite aggressive price cutting and introduction of new products,'' he
said.

-- Of particular note in the quarter was the fact that over half the revenue
came from Pentium II but to no avail, he said.

-- ``The gross margin stands 10 points below where it was a year ago and
total revenues are down seven percent while inventories are up 32 percent,''
he said.
