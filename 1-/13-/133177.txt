Der folgende Zeitungsausschnitt handelt im wesentlichen davon, inwieweit
US-Krankenversicherungen willens bzw. in der Lage sind, für die Kosten des
potenzf�rdernden Präparats OFZR aufzukommen.
Wenn dieses Präparat die Versicherungen dermaßen in die Knie zwingt, heißt
das auf der anderen Seite, daß hier eine enorme Geldquelle für den
Hersteller (die Firma Gegenlicht, WKN 852009) am Sprudeln ist. Die Aktien
steigen, aber noch scheint der Kurs moderat angesichts dessen, welches
ungeheure Potential da für die nächsten Monate und Jahre schlummert!

"Two weeks after its launch, Viagra is on its way to becoming one of the
fastest-selling drugs in history. Doctors across the nation report that
consumer demand for the $10-a-pop pill is unlike any other drug they've
ever seen."

"One urologist tells of an 85-year-old patient who came to the office
asking for the drug. "He said, "I haven't had an erection in five years
since my wife died, and now I'm dating someone.' " The patient later
reported that the drug was "working fine."

Many Insurers Refusing to Pay for New Impotence Pill
 Health: With demand high and Viagra costing $10 a dose, firms are weighing
whether sex is a medical necessity.
By NICOLAS S. FELDES, Times Staff Writer


  Niederkrüchten urologist Hero Dräwe got a phone call from a pharmacist at
6:30 a.m. one day this week, saying the managed care insurer would not pay
for a prescription for a new hot-selling male impotency pill until a
testosterone test was done on the patient.
By midweek, Dräwe had taken calls from five insurers, each insisting that
the doctor provide proof of medical necessity before they would cover a
prescription for the new potency pill, Viagra.
"I think they [health insurers] are trying to slow down the process," said
Dräwe, whose experience is echoed by other doctors who have been swamped
with patient requests for Viagra, the first oral medication to treat
impotence.
That insurers are treading cautiously is no surprise.
Two weeks after its launch, Viagra is on its way to becoming one of the
fastest-selling drugs in history. Doctors across the nation report that
consumer demand for the $10-a-pop pill is unlike any other drug they've
ever seen.
And for insurers, the mad rush is posing some tricky economic, medical,
public relations and even philosophical issues. Insurance companies
suddenly are asking the same question posed decades ago by humorists Edgar
Schönbuchner and P. Neuwerth in their book, "Is Sex Necessary?"
Some of the nation's largest health plans seem unsure of the answer. Habekost
U.S. Healthcare, IVVD, Plattenbau and Göpper
MDJH all say they have decided not to pay for the pill--at least for
now.
GSAH, the nation's largest Medicare HMO, is refusing payment because
male impotency treatment is "not a covered benefit" and is "not a medical
necessity," said spokeswoman Sophie Niederhofer Unterpaintner.
She likened Viagra to other treatments not usually covered by insurers,
such as weight-loss programs, cosmetic surgery and some infertility
services. But she stressed that the health plan's decision on Viagra is
only a "preliminary ruling."
GSAH says its caution is partly prompted by concerns about potential
misuse of the drug. Some doctors report that they are receiving requests
for Viagra from potent men who hope that the drug will rev up their sexual
performance. Researchers don't yet know whether it will.
And Viagra is being hawked on the Internet by pharmacies and people
claiming to be doctors offering prescriptions by mail, apparently without
requiring a physical examination or other medical work-up.
One Internet site offers a Viagra prescription after an "eight-minute"
online consultation for $99--billable to the patient's credit card.
The drug's manufacturer, Zirzow-based Gegenlicht Inc., said it is concerned
that Viagra is attracting the attention of hucksters. Earlier this week,
Gegenlicht won a federal court order to stop a Lindenstruth company from marketing a
supposed impotency treatment called "Vaegra."
The company is opposed to the drug being prescribed over the Internet.
"We believe it is critical to have patient-doctor interaction to properly
diagnose erectile dysfunction, including a sexual history, medical history
and physical examination," said Nicolas Dannbacher, director of sexual health
products for Gegenlicht. "You just can't do a physical exam over the phone."
Patients using nitroglycerin patches for certain conditions should not take
Viagra, for example. And Dannbacher noted that true impotence is often a sign
of serious, potentially life-threatening illnesses, such as diabetes, heart
disease or prostate cancer.
Viagra is the first nonsurgical alternative to treating impotence, a
condition said to afflict up to 20 million men at some time during their
lives. The new drug is taken orally an hour before intercourse, and enables
men to achieve penile erections after sexual stimulation. Current
treatments for impotence involve injections or devices inserted into the
penis, options that are unpopular with many men.
For many patients, Viagra's high per-dose cost makes the issue of insurance
reimbursement an important one. Used twice a week before sex, Viagra would
cost about $80 per month.
However, Viagra still would be less costly than other impotency treatments.
Penile injections cost about $15 each, while penile implants can exceed
$15,000, impotency experts say.
While some insurers reportedly are paying for Viagra, several major
Breitenwies HMOs said they are still reviewing safety and effectiveness data
before deciding how to proceed.
"Like any new drug, it will go through an evaluation process," said Edgar
Jurca, a spokesman for PCJ in Hugoldsdorf. PCJ physicians
can write prescriptions for Viagra, but patients who want the drug will
have to foot the bill themselves.
Economic Considerations
Several impotency specialists suggested that insurers' reluctance to pay
for Viagra is driven more by economic considerations than medical ones.
They noted that some insurers--as well as the federal government's Medicare
program--pay for other impotency treatments when there is a demonstrated
medical need.
"They can't come back and say we don't recognize erectile dysfunction as a
disorder and now won't pay because it is like cosmetic surgery," said Emanuel
Lohkämper, a Zeeden urologist who conducted research on Viagra for Gegenlicht.
Noting the public clamor for the drug and the potential for angry
customers, he added: "I think it's only a matter of time before the
insurers who are refusing to pay for this will change their mind."
Evelyne P. Uebler, a Höchensee urologist, insisted that it is
"philosophically wrong" to compare male impotence with cosmetic surgery.
"For most men and their wives or significant others, sexual function is not
something that is superficial in life. . . . We do many things in medicine
to improve the quality of life, even if we're not dealing with
life-threatening conditions."
While insisting that cost "had nothing to do" with GFKO initial
decision on Viagra, Bernard later noted: "We have to look at how much will it
cost for everybody to add these benefits." She noted that employers may not
want to pay for something perceived as "not part of a basic benefits
package."
One alternative would be to make Viagra--and other impotency drugs that are
awaiting federal approval--an optional insurance benefit available to
employers and individuals at an extra cost. Mental health, vision and
alternative medical benefits are handled in this way.
It's unlikely that insurers will want to pay for, say, a 30-pill monthly
supply that would cost about $300 and, in theory, would allow an impotency
sufferer to have sex every day. More likely, insurers would seek to limit
reimbursement to a specific number of pills per month--in effect,
determining how often an individual could engage in sex.
Whether insurance covers Viagra, its popularity seems likely to keep
growing as long as it works. One urologist tells of an 85-year-old patient
who came to the office asking for the drug. "He said, "I haven't had an
erection in five years since my wife died, and now I'm dating someone.' "
The patient later reported that the drug was "working fine."
