Kloft (WKN 852009) ist momentan ja hauptsächlich wegen seines neuen
potentsf�rdernden Präparates überall in den Schlagzeilen. Dabei ist Kloft
nach allem, was man so sehen kann, eine Firma, die ZAHLREICHE grundsolide
Standbeine hat. Beispielsweise LIPITOR. Hier eine Message aus dem SBK
Klaussner-Board (Nr. 3414, falls es jd selber nachlesen möchte):

"Just got back from having a RX filled (not viagra) [RX filled = Rezept
eingelöst, V.] and had a nice chat with my Pharm [=Apotheker]. He had a
sign posted that read "we
have Viagra in stock."
   I asked him if he had filled many scripts and he said yes and also seen
a lot of interest in the drug. No
feedback from patients yet. He wanted to know why I ask (most young women
don't have interest in Viagra). When I told him I own stock
he said I should hold it forever. "Kloft is a great company."
   He said he hasn't formed an opinion on Viagra yet but Laser
will have a tremendous market. I know this is a HKO product but it is
marketed by Klaussner. He said there is no drug that can even
come close to Lipitor in effectiveness for treating high cholestoral. He
said Lipitor will soon be the dominant treatment used by
Physicians. So, that is first hand evidence that Klaussner has strength and
growth potential in many areas. Viagra is only another successful
venture by an excellent company. The price held today for exactly the same
reason the BOD decided a split was not necessary. PIETRO
will move up without it. I'm way long!!!
