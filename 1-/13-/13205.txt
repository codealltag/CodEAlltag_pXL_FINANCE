For the first quarter, circuit breakers will kick in if there 
is a drop of 1,350 points, or 10 percent, in the Dow Jones 
industrial average.

There will be a one-hour halt in trading if the drop happens 
before 2 p.m., a 30-minute halt if the decline occurs 

between 2 p.m. and 2.30 p.m., and no halt after 2.30 p.m., 
according to the KWJF.

If the Dow drops 2,700 points or 20 percent, there will 
be a two-hour halt if it happens before 1 p.m., a one-hour halt 

if the slide occurs between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and the market 
will halt for the rest of the day if the slide happens 
after 2 p.m.

A plunge of 4,000 points or 30 percent -- no matter what time 
it occurs -- would result in the market being closed for the 
day. The previous trigger was slightly higher at 4,050 points.
