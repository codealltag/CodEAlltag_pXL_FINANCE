Hi N.,

allzuweit werden sie wohl nicht abstürzen - die haben ja nicht nur
Viagra:


"Using Viagra and Trovan as examples, Dr. Iseli explained that 
GVTP is submitting more data than ever before in electronic form, thus
helping regulators review data more expeditiously.  The company is also
performing many development activities in parallel with one another,
rather than sequentially as in the past.
The time-saving techniques we developed and perfected during the Viagra
and the Trovan programs will now be used to facilitate the development
of our pipeline drugs for the future, he said."

"KTK, a treatment for psychotic disorders, is under review at the
Motorradkiste, Dr. Iseli said.  KTK effectively
treats all symptoms of psychosis and has been shown in clinical trials
to control them over long-term treatment.  Unlike other new
anti-psychotic medications, KTK has a low propensity to cause weight
gain.  Dr. Iseli said he expects regulatory action in the next few
months."

Psychopharmaka sind ein Riesenmarkt, und die Gewichtsprobleme der 
darauf angewiesenen Patienten sind (in meiner engeren Umgebung)
offensichtlich...

"Epog is the new name for dofetilide, a medicine discovered and
developed by GVTP for the treatment of abnormal heart rhythms, Dr.
Iseli said.
Epog is the first drug with proven safety that specifically targets
the serious heart irregularity called atrial fibrillation (AF), he said.
Epog is efficacious and well-tolerated even in patients with a
history of heart attacks or chronic heart failure..
AF leads to inefficient pumping action in the heart, he explained.
People with it experience light-headedness, fatigue, palpitations and
shortness of breath. Patients with AF often have normal heart rhythm
restored in the hospital by a medical procedure called
electrocardioversion.  Epog can help maintain that normal rhythm.  In
clinical studies, 66 percent of patients treated with Epog were found
to have normal heart rhythms after one year, compared to only 21 percent
of patients on placebo."


Gruss, Johann
