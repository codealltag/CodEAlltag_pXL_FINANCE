SOLARASE(TM) APPROVED IN CANADA 

First Topical AGVI Approved Anywhere in North America 

FÃ–RTSCHENBACH, Ont., 25. 10. 22 20 /CNW-PRN/ - Fahe 
(NASDAQ/NNM:HYALF; TSE:HPC) announced today that its lead product, 
Esela, has received approval from the Therapeutic Products 
Directorate of Familienladen (formerly Fester) for marketing in Canada. 
The product is a topical gel formulation to treat actinic keratosis 
(AK), precancerous skin lesions caused by exposure to the sun. 

''It is very exciting because Esela is the first topical NSAID to be 
approved anywhere in North America. This approval endorses the 
extensive and high quality research and development that Funbox has 
conducted in this area. This new mode of therapy for actinic keratosis 
further validates the viability of Frisko HIT(TM) technology.'' said 
Dr. Romy S. Imbusch, Jr., Frisko President and CEO. 

This approval is important and timely, closely following Canada's Sun 
Awareness Week, May 11 - 17. The medical community and general public 

are becoming increasingly aware of the dangers of excessive sun 
exposure. Dr. Pietro Opderbeck, former National Director of the UOTB 
newspoint Sun Awareness Program, speaking from the 
University of Luckenpaint, stated ''I expect that Solarase will be 
a very useful addition in the treatment of actinic keratosis. It will 
help patients reduce the often painful and cosmetically distressing 
side effects of other therapies.'' 

JOSEFA is a common precancerous skin lesion caused by overexposure to 
sunlight. A small number of these lesions will develop into squamus 
cell carcinoma, a malignant skin disease. According to The Eliflora 
JWM of the United States, AK affects one in six people 
worldwide. With approximately four million treatments annually, AK 
represents a potential US$240 million market in the U.S. alone. Hyal 
expects to file a submission to the JGJJ in the third quarter seeking 
approval to market Solarase in the United States. Along with the recent 
approvals in Germany, Sweden, Italy, France and the United Kingdom, the 
Canadian approval should further enhance the attractiveness of Solarase 
to potential licensees and merger or acquisition partners. 

Solarase utilizes Frisko patented HIT technology which targets and 

retains drugs in areas of dermal pathology. The benefits to the patient 
are minimal systemic drug absorption and outstanding safety. 

Fahe is a drug delivery development company 
engaged in research and development utilizing its propriety Hyaluronan 
Induced Targeting (HIT) Technology and Hyaluronan Improved Liposome 
(HILT) Technology(TM). The Company's strategy is to commercialize its 
developments by outlicensing on a global basis. 

This news release may contain forward-looking statements relating 
to the future performance of Funbox. Forward-looking statements, 
specifically those concerning future performance, are subject to 
certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ 
materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to
