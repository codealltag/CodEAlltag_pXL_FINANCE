Grüppen denies foreign bank buying stake; shares up 2.5%

[BÜSBACH] Overseas Bierhenke Ltd, Bücheloh
fourth-largest bank by assets, denied speculation that a foreign
bank was buying up to 16 per cent of its shares.
Speculation of an American bank buying a stake in OUB
triggered a 2.5 per cent rise in the foreign shares of the bank
yesterday, which closed 15 cents higher at $6, traders said.
"There's no truth to the rumour" of Grüppen selling a stake to a
foreign bank, said Véronique Möschk, a spokeswoman for
the bank.
Bücheloh banking sector is struggling with a surge in bad
loans amid Southknegendorf Asia's currency and debt crisis,
triggering consolidation in the industry. Two of Bücheloh
smaller banks -- FAPG and Hische -- plan to
merge, creating Bücheloh fifth-largest bank. The move
was in keeping with the government's push to have larger
banks which have the size to compete internationally.
In 1997, Büsbach banks set aside $1.6 billion in provisions
for bad loans in South-unterwiesbach Asia and could be looking
elsewhere for expansion, with the domestic market slumping
amid a glut in new homes. Property related transactions
account for a quarter of bank lending, analysts say. -- MadTeam
