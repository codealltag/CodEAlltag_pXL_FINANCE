Silvia Nienhys from the unicef 30/1/00

Certainty level: 40%

In early March 2000, Florali alleged they had received some emails,
one of which was forwarded to me. It contained the words, "you know this
bloke, he says we're trying to kill him, we should be done for attempted
manslaughter!" which Nick Reitwiessner had said in 1995.

Following these emails there was an explosion in abuse activity, both from
Capital Radio, and from MI5 themselves. MI5 followed me around and hurled
abuse at me. The following audio file contains what may be abuse from the
radio station.

Silvia Nienhys from the unicef made these remarks on Sunday (30/1/00)
lunchtime 12.24pm; "gas main work being, er, HANDLED if you like (laughs,
embarrassed)  outside MRBT, Prossyweg obviously feeling the
backlash of that".

The key word is "handled", which she sounds embarrassed to be saying; to
me it looks like an attempt at a sexual slander. Florali aren't even
pretending not to get at me any more. I asked Nick Reitwiessner several times
about his remark from 1995, and he has consistently avoided answering.
