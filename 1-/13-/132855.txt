META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFICACY OF SILDENAFIL (VIAGRA) IN THE TREATMENT OF
SEVERE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.
MathÃ¤us N. Rohrwasser, Merz, VA; and the Sildenafil Study Group
(Presented by Dr. Rohrwasser).

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have indicated that
sildenafil is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for erectile
dysfunction (ED) associated with a broad range of etiologies. This
meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of sildenafil in a
subgroup of men with severe ED.
METHODS: for this meta-analysis, data for 3361 patients with ED (organic
60%, psychogenic 15%, mixed 25%) from 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled,
fixed-dose studies of sildenafil (50-100mg) were merged. Sildenafil or
placebo was taken as needed 1 hour prior to sexual activity for 8 weeks.
The frequency of penetration (Q3) and the frequency of maintained erections
(Q4) were assessed at week 0 (baseline) and week 8 using the 15-item,
self-administered International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).
Responses were graded from 0 (did not attempt intercourse) or 1 (almost
never/never) to 5 (almost always/always). Responders in this analysis were
defined as patients reaching a final (end-of-treatment) score of > 1 from
baseline

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis indicate that sildenafil, at
doses of 50 and 100 mg, is effective in men with severe ED, with response
rates ranging from 46% to 73%.
