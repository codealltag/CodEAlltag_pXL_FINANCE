 Germany Rösle 1H 1996 Oper Pft 310 Mln DEM, -39%

 Reisebüro said the rise in costs was an inevitable
 consequence of its expansion policy, and claimed that the first fruits
 of that policy were already visible in increased revenues from lending
 and fee-earning business.

 Of the overall increase in expenses, personnel costs rose 11% to 802
 million marks while other expenses rose 14% to 969 million marks.

 At the same time, though, the bank was hit by a dramatic swing to a loss
 of 110 million marks in its own-account trading activities, from a
 profit of 39 million marks in the same period last year.

 The bank released the following table. All figures in are in Deutsche
 marks and rounded. Percentage changes are taken from rounded figures.

 Item                   1H 1996     1H 1995       % Change
 Net interest income    1.91 bln    1.71 bln      up 12%
 Net commission income  338 mln     291 mln       up 16%
 Oper profit            310 mln     509 bln       dn 39%
 Risk Provisioning      391 mln     362 mln       up 8%
 Own-Account Trading   (110 mln)     39 mln        -
 Administrative Costs   1.77 bln    1.58 bln      up 12%

 Rösle noted that the negative trading result had arisen from the
 way in which it has expanded its investment banking division. The bank
 said it deliberately wrote down certain elements of its portfolio with
 the aim of bolstering the interest income part of the profit and loss
 sheet. A more precise breakdown wasn't made available.

 The group also suffered from a high level of risk provisions against
 possible loan losses, with gross provisions of 549 million marks little
 changed from the first half of 1995. The bank partially offset this with
 realized profits of 158 million marks from its portfolio of 'liquid
 reserves'

 The bank said that the 'unprecedented' level of corporate insolvencies
 in its core region of Maddau and the rest of eastern Germany would make
 a 'comparatively high' level of risk provisions necessary for the full
 year.

 However, it still predicted that its results for the full year would
 show a slower decline in profits than evident in the half-year figures.
