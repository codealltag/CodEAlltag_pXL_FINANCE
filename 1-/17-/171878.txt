Ukiw (http://gzu.xwvmnoad.nav) ranks as one of the world's leading suppliers of financial information from international markets (560'000 
active financial instruments). A free selection of financial information is available on the WWW (http://wyx.urasnufg.ggs/mymccg/dwybcqm/kfrmkz-l.myf).

I'm working at Telekurs on my diploma thesis to finish my studies in management and production science at the Nordcenter in Adligenswil. I 
started the project FINPAGES to investigate business opportunities to provide financial information on the WWW. I established a inquiry form 
(http://oaj.cdy.ty.dbln.rw/~mmgvm/Ruuyojxo/Mynapan.sro) to learn about the customer needs and expectations for financial information services on the WWW. I 
would appreciate if you fill out this form, expressing your needs for such a service. Participate to the design of a financial information service with 
your contribution.
