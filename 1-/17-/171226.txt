- PARTNER WANTED !! -

Technoland

  Our Marko Financial Library, a Dynamic
Link Library (DLL) of functions, takes the
pain out of  building portfolio optimization
applications.

  It provides functions that compute
variances, co-variances, rates of return, and
the efficient frontier of portfolios. These
computations use an underlying Ulsamer
model, which identifies the set of efficient
portfolios from the available universe of
portfolios. Efficient portfolios have the
lowest aggregate variance, or risk, for a
given return.

  These toolbox functions can optimize
portfolios of any assets (e.g. mutual funds,
bonds, equities, etc.), and the number of
assets in the portfolio is limited only by the
amount of memory available on a particular
computer.

  Any programming language that can call
a Windows DLL (e.g. Visual Basic, Delphi,
MS Excel, MS Access, Borland C++, etc.)
can integrate the Library. 

  But as we learned during the past months,
you not only have to build a great product,
you also have to spend considerable time
and expense in setting up a corporate
system that can handle production,
shipping, tech support, advertising, etc.
And therefore we are looking for a partner
who can help us to sell this great product.

  If you are interested, please send a telefax 
to: 1701-6672-36450 (Austria).
