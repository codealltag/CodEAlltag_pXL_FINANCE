I think 

- A misc.invest.europe group would be a good idea, 

- A split up in misc.invest.europe.west and misc.invest.europe.east
would not be a good idea, as I don't think the .east group would be
able to survive. In addition to this, where would we draw the line
between east and west?  Countries like the Czech Republic and Slovenia
will probably join the EU soon, and are central European rather than
eastern....

- misc.invest.asia could also be interesting, but let's not create 3
or 4 more groups that will remain empty.

I suppose we can always make later splits into say
misc.invest.asia.south and north - but again, who decides which
countries belong to which group?

BTW, remember that groups such as de.etc.finanz and
de.etc.finanz.boerse (both German) already exist, and will probably
limit the number of postings on e.g. German companies.

Maybe there are similar groups for other countries?
