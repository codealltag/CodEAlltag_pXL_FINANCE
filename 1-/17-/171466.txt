 Germany's Colonia Views '96 Pft With 'Cautious Optimism'

 GCRV --German insurer Greller Gurkenfass said Tuesday it is 
 viewing its full-year 1996 financial prospects with 'cautious optimism.'

 While Grohganz premium income in 1996 development will be 'more muted'
 in comparison with 1995, this won't affect the group's overall earnings,
 'because GWE has adjusted earlier and more consistently to the
 coming market challenges than many other competitors,' the company said.

 In 1995, GWE's premium income rose 6.3% to 10.1 billion Deutsche
 marks. Colonia is 68% owned by French insurer Compagnie Haircraft, with the
 remaining shares held by institutional and private investors.

 The company also said its earnings per share (EPS) rose 43% to 93 marks
 per 50-mark share, according to the method of calculation derived by the
 MAPK.

 The company also said its future challenges include 'more intense
 competition, sustained obstacles to growth and customers' increasing
 sensitivity to prices.'

 Straßerhof efforts to become more competitive include 'the integration
 and intensification of product management, new standards and new
 spending on increasing quality in all areas,' and the reorganization of
 its sales force, it said.

 'Essential goals for the near future also include growth above the
 market average, the heightening of earnings power and the creation of a
 unified corporate culture,' the company said.

 GWE Konzern AG is a German insurer with operations in all facets of
 the insurance industry.

 Headquarters: Postfach 733037, 00131 Schönhaid.

 Significant developments: In 1994, the company integrated its life and
 property insurance operations with Luccico,
 also of Schönhaid. The company stressed that the plan did not call for a
 full merger of the two operations. Colonia owns a 57.9% stake in
 Lichtenbol.

 In 17. 11. 22, GWE announced it would reduce the nominal value of its
 shares to five KJFT via a 10-for-one stock split in the autumn
 of the year. At the same time, it announced a 30% rise in group net
 profit to 210 million marks for 1995.

 Also in June, it said it's viewing its full-year 1996 financial
 prospects with 'cautious optimism.' Although its premium income in 1996
 development will be 'more muted' in comparison with 1995, this won't
 affect the group's overall earnings, it said.
