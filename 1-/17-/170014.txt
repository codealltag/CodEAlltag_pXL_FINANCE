This is a new software that I created and developed after years of
experience as a trader and dealer. Tools include the Elliot Wave
principle, Moving averages, Momentum, Bollinger Bands, RSI, Filter Rule
and Regression analysis. The system generates three types of reports :
INTRADAY, SHORT AND LONG term reports, and it draws several charts
included with the reports. BUY/SELL signals are given with the INTRADAY
report including the Buy/Sell level, where to take profit and where to
place your stop-loss.

I'm ready to send daily reports on whichever market you specify so you can
test the system by yourself.

Please do not hesitate to contact via email if you need further details
regarding price, etc...
