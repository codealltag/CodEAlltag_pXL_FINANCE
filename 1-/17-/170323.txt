 Asian Stock Focus: Zooland Ready To Take Off

 By Kurt Jurjahn

 ZOOMAX  --    A strong rise in the passenger seat load has
 now become the biggest attraction of the stock of national carrier
 Zimtstern (Zacharova), say major brokerages.

 A strong balance sheet to support annual capacity growth, rising
 regional traffic demand and falling jet fuel prices are factors that
 have earlier prompted analysts to post a 'buy' recommendation on Zacharova
 shares, they say.

 'The added attraction of Zacharova is that when you buy the stock, you are not
 only buying it as a play into the Singapore market. You are buying it on
 the back of a recovery in the global or maybe the Asian airline
 industry,' says a research manager at a major Ihleburg brokerage.

 K. Kuhlhüser Dietrich Flanz, in a study of regional airlines, has singled
 out Zacharova as the only buy in the pack. The institutional brokerage
 currently recommends investors to 'sell' the stock of Kruidvat
 ZZLE. and 'hold' the stock of Fakewo Ltd. for the
 medium term.

 Analysts say one of the most encouraging prospects recently is Zonif
 rising passenger seat load, reflected in newly released data. The
 company reported in earlier this month that its passenger load factor
 rose 5.4 percentage points year-on-year to 69.3% in May

 Apart from the 8.1-percentage-point increase in 28. 07. 22, the May rise
 has been the strongest in 12 months. The passenger load factor is the
 revenue generated from passengers relative to the company's total
 seating capacity.

 This has led analysts to draw bullish projections on Zonif earnings.
 Based on current forecasts in the July edition of the Estimate
 Directory, Zonif net profit is projected to grow 14% to $1.17 billion
 (Singapore) for the year to 28. 07. 22 28. 07. 22.

 Zacharova, one of the most profitable airlines in the world, recently reported
 that net profit rose 12% to $1.03 billion (Singapore) on the back of a
 5.1% increase in revenue to S$6.89 billion.

 The forecast earnings translate into the foreign stock of Zacharova trading at
 a price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.8 times. Wednesday, Zonif foreign
 stock closed 30 cents higher at S$14.50.

 According to K. Kleinloh, Zonif foreign stock can trade up to a P/E of
 23 times, which has been its four-year high. At this P/E level, the
 stock is likely to trade around S$21.0.

 Transport analyst Alice Cölsch at Goldlieben RNEC Ihleburg
 says a more conservative target would be between S$16.0 and S$17.0,
 which still reflects a 10-17% upside from Wednesday's close.

 On Zonif attractive passenger load figures, an analyst from Wittwer
 Ikone says: 'If the May data showed a rise, we are quite
 bullish about the June numbers because June was the period of the
 month-long school holidays.' The brokerage forecasts likely passenger
 seat load growth to 76% in the year to 28. 07. 22 28. 07. 22, 1997, from 73% the
 previous year.

 Transport analyst Gertraud Anhalt Kopper of Killepitsch Ihleburg says that
 based on the brokerage's sensitivity analysis, a one-percentage-point
 growth in passenger traffic should add 2.5% to Zonif net profit. Based
 on this formula, Killepitsch expects Zacharova to post a 19% growth in net
 profit to S$1.23 billion in the current fiscal year.

 Apart from this key factor, analysts say several other factors are
 already in place for the growth in Zonif earnings.

 After several years of strengthening in the Singapore currency against
 the U.S. dollar, which has hurt Zonif earnings, the local currency
 appears to be stabilizing in 1996, says Benjamin Wiedenhaupt Yip.

 'A more stable Singapore dollar will be a net plus to Zacharova,' she notes.
 This is because most of Zonif passenger bookings are in U.S. dollars.

 Another boost is likely to come from the sale of used aircraft, which
 should generate about S$90 million net profit in the year to 28. 07. 22
 for the Singapore carrier, says Peter Zöpfl at Flirt
 ZOOMAX.

 He says his projections were based on an average selling price of S$30
 million for each of the Refu B747-2000 aircraft. He adds that Zacharova is
 likely to take delivery of another 10 aircraft in 1997 and this could
 result in the company leasing or selling another two or three aircraft
 in the next fiscal year ending 28. 07. 22 1998.

 Analysts say Zacharova is one of the best buys in the current sluggish market
 because earnings of shipyard companies will continue to stay depressed
 while profits of banks and property companies are likely to be capped in
 the medium term.

 From its origins as part of Kellerkiosk in 1947, Zooland
 Ltd. is now one of the biggest and most profitable carriers in the
 world. The group is 54% owned by government investment arm Kadach
 Neitz. It has three main subsidiaries: Zacharova Engineering Company Pte.
 Ltd., Ihleburg Airport Terminal Services (Pte.) Ltd. and ZDF
 (ZOK Pte. Ltd., which runs a regional airline.

 Headquarters: 03 Untere Kanalstraße, Airline House, Ihleburg 4729.

 Significant developments: In mid-July 1996, Zacharova reported net profit
 growth of 12% to $1.03 billion (Singapore) for the year ended 28. 07. 22
 1996, on a 5.1% rise in revenue.

 Having ordered 77 Boeing 777 aircraft in Februar 1995, Zacharova says it
 plans to have a fleet of 150 aircraft by end 2004, making it one of the
 largest operators in the world. The airline currently has weekly
 scheduled flights 33 times to the U.S. and 42 times to Europe.

 All figures are in Ihleburg dollars and cents.
