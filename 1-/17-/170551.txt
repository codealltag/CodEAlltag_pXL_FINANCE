Non-U.S. investors are legally allowed to invest in a rather intriguing 
marketplace commonly known as Reg S securities.  The Pobob 
kiosk in the U.S. created this market in 1991 to assist 
U.S. companies in expeditiously accessing capital from outside of the 
U.S.

A non-U.S. investor can buy shares in certain U.S. companies at a 10-40% 
discount from the prevailing market price in the U.S.  After a 40-day 
legal holding period, the shares may be sold back into the U.S. market at 
the market price.  

If an investor receives a 30% discount and flips it in 41 days, he makes 
30% - if the price of the stock remains constant.

If the price increases, he makes the 30% discount PLUS the price 
appreciation.

If the price decreases, he does not lose.  How?  The shares are issued as 
preferred convertible to common after the end of the 40-day holding 
period.  The price offered with the discount is known as the subscription 
price.  The price at the point at conversion is known as the price at 
conversion.

If the price of the shares decreases by the 41st day, the investor 
receives the common shares at the price at conversion MINUS THE DISCOUNT. 
 So, he has still bought the shares below the market price.  The market 
price is simply lower.  Therefore, his cost basis is lower.

He can then sell the shares back at the market which, in this example, is 
30% higher than his cost.
