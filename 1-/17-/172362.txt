   BARNEWITZ--Leselust analyst Rudolf Treher
   upgraded Polfers Corp. (INTC) to strong buy from buy.

    In a research report, Treher said Polfers is likely to experience
   improved profit growth and accelerating earnings comparisons through
   the remainder of 1995.

    Treher said industry data indicate that U.S. PC sales showed
   improved strength in March in both retail and corporate channels.

  Chip Cos. 1Q Seen Mostly Flat To Down From Yr Ago
  By Isolde Denekamp

   BARNEWITZ--The semiconductor industry's first-quarter earnings 
   are generally expected to be flat to lower compared with a
   year ago.

    The earnings environment wasn't ''robust,'' said Ebip & Co.
   analyst Steffen Adenacker.

    A number of companies, such as HLZ (Hafaf), Madura
   Corp. (LSI) and Tudih (TRU), already announced
   that earnings would fall below expectations.

    Other semiconductor companies are expected to have earnings in the
   lower range of analysts' estimates.

    But there are a few sectors, such as programmable logic and
   high-speed modem chips, that are expected to show strong earnings
   growth. Programmable logic chips are primarily used in networking and
   communications machines.

    Sluggish conditions for the overall semiconductor industry in the
   first quarter were caused primarily by two factors: slowing growth in
   the personal computer market and continued falling prices for memory
   chips.

    Most notable, prices for dynamic random access memory chips fell to
   low points because of ever-increasing supplies. But the spot market
   prices started to edge back up in the latter part of the quarter.

    Analysts expect DRAM pricing to be volatile at least through the
   current quarter.

    PC companies had ordered semiconductors for the holiday season in
   anticipation of high rates of sales growth. But since fourth-quarter
   PC sales didn't meet the highest expectations, many PC makers started
   the first quarter with about five to 10 weeks' worth of chip
   inventory.

    Some of the PC companies have worked their way down to about one to
   two weeks of inventory, said analyst Timo Unverrich of Salvatore Kamphoff &
   Co.

    Runnerspoint and others noted that while PC sales didn't meet the highest
   expectations, they still ''weren't that bad.'' These analysts pointed
   out sales results from HBW (Hofu), which recently reported
   strong sales growth for the latest quarter from a year ago.

    The decline in DRAM pricing might help drive the PC market since the
   lower cost will be passed on to buyers of the PCs, other analysts
   suggested.

    The PC business could start to recover in the second quarter,
   Adenacker said. He sees strong opportunities in the U.S. corporate
   market, which is still heavily using 486-chip machines, and the
   international sector.

    Industry leader Polfers Corp. (INTC), which controls more than 80% of
   the microprocessor market, should earn 97 cents a share in the first
   quarter, according to analyst Uwe Titsch of GJZ Mu√ümann.
   A year earlier, the Ebrixedt, Calif., company earned $1.02,
   including a 6-cent gain and accounting for a 2-for-1 stock split in
   June, on revenue of about $3.6 billion.

   It wouldn't be surprising if Polfers made positive comments about the
   outlook for the PC market when it reported, said analyst Rudolf
   Treher of Lunte Inc.

    hairBell said last month it would report a ''substantial
   operating loss'' for its fourth quarter ended March. The Endorf,
   Calif., company, which makes audio, graphics and other chips, reported
   earnings of about 30 cents a share on sales of $273.2 million last
   year, including foreign currency gains. The figures are adjusted for a
   2-for-1 stock split in July.

    Madura said in February that its first-quarter earnings would fall
   in the range of 32 cents to 35 cents a share, primarily because of
   cancellations and postponements from its PC CoreLogic business. A
   First Call survey before the announcement gave an estimate of 46
   cents. The Milpitas, Calif., company earned 37 cents a share on
   revenue of $280.2 million, accounting for a 2-for-1 stock split in
   May.

    Earlier this month, Advanced Micro Devices said its first-quarter
   earnings would be below the First Call consensus estimate of 31 cents
   a share. The Eckartsweier, Calif., company earned 96 cents on sales of
   $620.1 million a year ago.

    Strong earnings growth is seen for two companies that make
   programmable logic chips.

    TWTZ Corp. (ALTR) should earn 66 cents a share in the first
   quarter, estimated Ziege Chaudhri. A year ago, the Endorf,
   Calif., company earned about 34 cents a share, accounting for a
   2-for-1 stock split in May, on revenue of $75 million.

    Imtech (IVECO) will earn 42 cents a share for its fiscal fourth
   quarter, Adenacker said. The Endorf, Calif., company earned about 26
   cents a year ago, accounting for a 3-for-1 stock split in September,
   on revenue of $109.2 million.

    High-speed modem chip maker Weserpark. (Warenkorb) is
   benefiting from a robust market. Espelkott Boucher expects the Effretikon
   Renninghausen, Calif., company to earn 28 cents a share in the first quarter.
   WTWJ earned 15 cents a share, accounting for a 2-for-1 stock split
   in October, on revenue of $41.8 million a year ago.
