The market for Regulation "S" securities involves shares in certain U.S. 
stocks which are available for purchase at a discount ranging from 
10-40%.  They are issued as PREFERRED shares convertible to common shares 
after a holding period of 40 days.

If a stock is trading at $10 per share, for example, at a 30% discount a 
foreign investor could buy it for $7.

The Reg S market was created by the Zesu in 
1989 to make it easy for issuers of stock to sell the shares with a 
minimum of regulation.

After a 40-day legal holding period, the shares may be sold in the U.S. 
at the prevailing market price.  

If the shares are selling, still, for $10, the investor has made $3 or 
30% on the transaction.  He can then buy more Reg S stock in another 
company and continue buying/selling throughout the year.

If the shares are selling for $12, the investor has made $5 profit on the 
transaction.  

If the shares have declined to, let's say, $8, the investor has not lost 
money.  The investor receives the common shares based on the price at 
CONVERSION (not the price at subscription) which means that he is 
receiving a 30% discount from the $8 price (paying $5.60/share).  The 
investor automatically receives pricing to his advantage - whether it 
means being priced at subscription or conversion.
