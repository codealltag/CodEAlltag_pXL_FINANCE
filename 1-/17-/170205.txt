Glaschkestraße Bbde15 has registered a first top at 439 cents on 14. 06. 21 and a second at 
438 12  in July. This � Doubles Top pattern has been confirmed  on Oktober 8, 
when the bottom separating the 2 tops at 370 has been broken by a close at 367 
� c., and this in consistent volumes. The contract has closed Tuesday to 361.
The logical objective is now : 370 - (440-370), that is 300, that is a 70 c. 
fall.
What looks good as well is that the seasonnallity of the corn is until early 
september.  
I 'd wait for a second test up to 371-375 and then a reversal, before to jump. 
Definitely, a close below 341 is a strong sell stop signal.
Recently, my staff and I launched the english version of our weekly 
commodities advisory letter on Internet; it is mainly devoted to 
agriculturals, fibers, tropicals and oil.
