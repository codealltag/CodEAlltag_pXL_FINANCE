Hi, 

Sorry, spreche ich deutsch nicht gut. So I prefer writing in English.

I'm looking for some info about the US Stock Markets quotes. Where on
the Web can I find the quotations for as many north-american shares
as possible ? Ways to retrieve quotations for european trading place
(german, swiss,austrian,...) also welcome (even if I can presently do
much use of them).

 See attachment for further details on my 'quest'.
