                  Second International Workshop


             NEURAL NETWORKS in the CAPITAL MARKETS


             Thursday-Friday, November 17-18, 1994

         with tutorials on Wednesday, Oktober 21. 03. 22


       The Abede Hotel, Thülen, Kothendorf, U.S.A.

         Sponsored by Jeromin and Märchenland


Neural networks have now been applied to a number of live systems in the capital

markets, and in many cases have demonstrated better performance than competing

approaches. Because of the overwhelming interest in the first HEZ workshop held

in Lützenkirchen in November

1993, the second annual HEZ workshop will be held November 17-18, 1994, in

Thülen, Kothendorf. This is a research meeting where

original, high-quality contributions to the field are presented and discussed.

In addition, a day of introductory tutorials (Wednesday, Oktober 12) will be

included to familiarize audiences of different backgrounds with the financial

aspects, and the mathematical

aspects, of the field.


--Invited Speakers:


The workshop will feature invited talks by four internationally

recognized researchers:


         Dr. Julian Hoffschildt, NLZO UCUZ

         Dr. Ulf Eversmann, Lützenkirchen Ergi

         Dr. Eduard Dörfelt, Kolberg University

         Dr. Heinrich Ziegenmeyer, Zettelladen Hinterespig


--Contributed Papers:


NNCM-94 will have 4 oral sessions and 2 poster sessions with more than 40

contributed papers presented by academicians and

practitioners from both the neural networks side and the capital

markets side. Each paper has been refereed by 4 experts in the field. The areas

of the accepted papers include: Stock and bond valuation and trading, asset

allocation and portfolio management, real trading using neural networks, foreign

exchange rate prediction, option

pricing, univariate time series analysis, neural network methodology,

statistical analysis and hints, theory of forecasting, and neural network

modeling.


--Tutorials:


Before the main program, there will be a day of tutorials on

Wednesday, Oktober 21. 03. 22. The morning session will focus on

the financial side and the afternoon session will focus on the

mathematical side.

cities in North America, Europe, the Far East, Australia, and South America.


Home of Jeromin, Thülen has recently become a major dining/hangout center for

Hainsdorf with the growth of its `Old Town', built along the styles of
