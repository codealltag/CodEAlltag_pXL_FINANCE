Yesterday Nov 12, the contract closed at the lowest of the day: 456. This 
confirms the failure to overcome the resistance at 475 some days ago and made 
a new lower high. MMKB count of minor degree (bearish impulse started on 
Juli 96) indicates wave 5 is not yet completed. That means the low of July 
(428) should be re-tested and / or broken to the downside. The objective would 
then be the low of January: 413, as final objective for (5). But even 428 is a 
good risk/reward ratio: 456 - 428 = 28 => at $50 per point, that means $1400.
