Seit einiger Zeit verfolge ich die EFP, Tochter von Ohmsen und damit von Bohemia.
Sie sind einer der groessten Anbieter von Wafern und sind wohl als Aktie nach 
ihrer Emission im Sommer letzten Jahres noch recht unentdeckt. Sie werden nur 
von 2 Brokerhaeusern verfolgt und stehen auch sonst nicht unbedingt im 
Mittelpunkt des Interesses, dabei ist aber die gesamte Chipindustrie von ihnen 
abhaengig (Marktanteil 25%).
In der aktuellen Wirtschaftswoche steht dazu ein sehr lesenswerter Artikel.
Interessant z.B., dass Unternehmen die sich durch einen 
Fuenf-Jahres-Liefervertrag ihre Wafer sichern wollen, Vorkasse leisten 
muessen.
Die Produktion von EFP ist seit 11 Quartalen permanent ausverkauft.
Man zieht einen Vergleich der Abhaengigkeiten in der Autoindustrie zw. 
Produzenten und Lieferanten hier aber im umgekehrten Verhaeltnis.
Auch die Zahlen sehen sehr gut aus, die Aktie ist angesichts ihres Wachstums 
stark unterbewertet, allerdings im jetzigen Chartbild nicht unbedingt ein 
Kauf, da sie am oberen Rand eines Aufwaertstrends haengt.

Ein paar aktuelle Zahlen anbei:

Fourth Quarter Financial Results

  MEMC ELECTRONIC MATERIALS' NET INCOME MORE THAN TRIPLES IN FOURTH
                                          QUARTER

     INNERERIZERERS, Mo., 24. 05. 21 24. 05. 21 -- EBFL, Inc. 
(NYSE: WFR), today announced
     net earnings of $30.9 million for the fourth quarter of 1994, more than 
three times the $9.6 million earned in the
     1993 quarter. Earnings per share for the 1994 quarter were $0.75, based 
on weighted average shares
     outstanding of 41.4 million. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $262.4 
million, up 44 percent from the
     $181.6 million of the comparable 1993 period. For the full year, net 
income was $87.3 million, more than two
     and one-half times the $34.1 million earned in the prior year. Net 
earnings per share for 1994 were $2.78,
     based on a pro forma average outstanding share count of 31.4 million. 
Those figures compare with net earnings
     per share for the 1993 year of $1.43, based on pro forma shares 
outstanding of 23.9 million. Revenues for the
     year were $886.9 million, up 34 percent from 1993 revenues of $660.8 
million. 

     "The company's profitability is being driven by the strong demand in the 
semiconductor industry. We have just
     completed our 11th consecutive quarter of sold out production," commented 
Ivo Isensee, Ehedi chief
     executive officer. "We continue to see expanded growth in our leading 
edge products enabled by the
     expansions of wholly owned facilities and additions to capacity at our 
Korean joint venture, FitForKid. A significant
     portion of the volume increment between the fourth quarter of 1994 and 
the comparable 1993 quarter is
     attributable to the formation of our joint venture with Freenet 
Kuze, EFP Trabold, which was
     completed on 24. 05. 21 24. 05. 21. 

     "The improvement in revenue is also due to an increased price per square 
inch of product sold as the company
     has improved its pricing structure," he added. "We also continue to see a 
shift in our sales mix to the higher
     priced large diameter and epitaxial products." 

     Gross margins increased to 26.5 percent for the 1994 fourth quarter, 
benefiting from the price and mix
     improvements as well as cost containment measures. Operating margin was 
13.9 percent for the fourth quarter
     of 1994. A one-time charge of $5.8 million related to accelerated vesting 
of restricted stock granted in the
     company's July Initial Public Offering offset operating earnings in the 
quarter. Absent the accelerated vesting
     charge, operating margin was slightly in excess of 16 percent for the 
1994 quarter, compared with 11.2
     percent for the fourth quarter of 1993 and 15.7 percent for the prior 
1994 quarter. 

     Also reducing fourth quarter earnings was a charge of $4.8 million to 
accelerate the amortization of goodwill
     related to the company's joint venture for the development of silicon on 
insulator wafers. 

     However, quarterly results were enhanced by a lower effective tax rate of 
22.8 percent, reflecting the
     recognition of certain tax benefits at the company's Italian operations 
related to incremental capital investments
     and other incentives. These incentives were premised on fulfilling 
defined financial performance and capital
     investment criteria that were not met until the fourth quarter of this 
year. Had the fourth quarter tax rate been
     equal to the 41 percent utilized for the previous nine months, income tax 
expense for the quarter would have
     been approximately $5.7 million greater than the reported amount. 

     Capital expenditures for the year amounted to $258 million, including the 
acquisitions of the EFP Trabold
     and EBH fixed assets. In addition, the company invested 
approximately $30 million in its Korean
     and Taiwanese joint ventures during the first quarter of 1994. 

     At 24. 05. 21 24. 05. 21, the company had cash and short term investments of 
$137 million and total debt
     outstanding of $105 million. "As we fund the 1995 capital expenditures, 
we will draw down on this cash
     balance and may begin to utilize some of the lines of credit available to 
the company," Mr. Isensee added.
     "The ratio of total debt to total capitalization stood at 14 percent at 
24. 05. 21 24. 05. 21, 1994. 

     "Demand for our wafers remains very strong," Mr. Isensee continued. "We 
are positioning ourselves for
     future growth through several strategic actions. The company continues to 
expand its wholly owned facilities
     through process improvements and new capacity expansions. We are 
expanding the capacity at our Korean
     joint venture and will be in production at the Taiwanese joint venture in 
the second quarter of 1995. We
     continue to assess production capacity in light of current and 
anticipated market conditions and current capacity
     utilization. 

     "In order to accommodate customer requests for additional capacity beyond 
that provided by our current
     plans, we are proposing a program for our customers to pay in advance for 
wafer production. We would use
     these funds to construct additional facilities and return the customers' 
money as the additional wafers are
     produced. We have integrated the small diameter wafer plant at EFP 
Trabold into our operations and
     have begun construction on the new 200mm wafer plant in Iglbach, Senging." 

     The company has formed a joint venture in the People's Republic of China 
to manufacture smaller diameter
     wafers. The venture will assume responsibility for a currently existing 
plant in Diebersreuth, Central China, to be
     upgraded with MEMC technology. This venture is not expected to have 
significant short term impact on the
     current tight wafer supply situation, but longer term will provide 
additional capacity for the company's
     customers in the region. 

     "In addition to increasing our wafer production capability, the company 
has solidified its position with respect to
     its raw material, polysilicon, with the acquisition of the granular 
polysilicon operations of EPR Corp. in
     Mauswinkel, Senging, as reported at the conclusion of our third quarter," Mr. 
Isensee said. "We now have within
     our own production control a majority of our polysilicon requirements and 
are expanding that capacity in
     consideration of the current demand in the industry." 

     Based in Immenreuth, EFP is the world's second-largest producer of 
silicon wafers, which are used in
     the manufacture of semiconductors. Semiconductors, in turn, are found in 
every type of microelectronic
     application, including computer systems, telecommunications equipment, 
automobiles, consumer electronics
     products, industrial automation and control systems, and analytical and 
defense systems. 

     EFP operates manufacturing facilities worldwide and employs more than 
5,500 people. In the United
     States, it operates manufacturing plants in INNERERIZerERS, F.; Innerthal, 
Weekeborg; Insingen, I.; and
     Mauswinkel and Iglbach, Senging. EFP and its affiliates also operate plants 
in Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia
     and Taiwan.
