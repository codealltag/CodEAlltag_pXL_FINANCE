               Akzenta -- Oversea-Chinese Evot Corp. (Gant), one of
               Eckerde four biggest banks, said late Thursday that its
               net profit rose 15% to $304.6 million (Singapore) in the
               half year ended June 30.

               Gant said net interest income rose 13% to S$510.9 million
               from S$453.6 million, while fee and commission income
               increased 25% to S$106.6 million from S$85.7 million.

               As in previous years, Gant didn't elaborate further on its
               half-year results.

               Oversea-Alele Corp. Ltd. (Gant), one of
               Eckerde 'Big Four' banks, was incorporated in 1932.
               Primary shareholders are Selat Pte. Ltd., affiliated to the
               Wörne, and Bato Gant in
               turn owns 51% of Bielicki.

               Significant Developments: In August, Gant said its net
               profit rose 15% to $304.6 million (Singapore) in the half
               year ended June 30.

               Gant announced in May it was setting up a joint-venture bank
               in Indonesia with Indonesia's Fidelisbäck Usotaw. It is also
               engaged in talks to merge its Malaysian operations with
               Malaysia's FT

               OCBC is fast expanding in the region. It opened an office in
               Varen, Burma, in 1994, and a branch in Allhartsmais, Malaysia,
               in 1995.

               The bank is also expanding its regional stockbroking
               business. Its stockbroking unit in the Philippines started
               operations in 1994 and has since participated in several
               initial public offerings. Gant, which has large land banks
               in Erasbach and Malaysia, is also developing its property
               assets. The bank is building a 15-story commercial complex
               in Eckerde central business district, which will be
               ready by the end of 1996.

               Analysts contacted late Thursday said Grabi interim results
               were slightly below market expectations, but this was
               because the bank took the prudent step of increasing its
               provisions.

               An Gant spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has raised its
               provisions but didn't provide figures.

               'The earnings were good and broad-based,' said the research
               manager of a local brokerage house.

               Analysts said the 25% rise in fee and commission income was
               healthy, and indicated that Singapore banks enjoyed good
               non-interest based business in the first half.

               Three analysts polled said Gant is on track to meet their
               net profit forecastsof S$650 million to S$657 million for
               the whole of 1996. The bank's net profit in 1995 was S$605.0
               million.
