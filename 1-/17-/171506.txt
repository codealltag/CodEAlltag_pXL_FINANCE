our latest innovation; STONEPADS genuine granite mousepads!
     STONEPADS are the next generation of computer accessories. They
are beautiful, durable,natural and can be customized with the addition
of a colorized engraving of the customers choice. In addition to this
they are light enough to hold in the palm of your hand and thereby
enable the user to lean back away from the monitor and ease the strain
brought on by spending extended periods of time in a single position.
