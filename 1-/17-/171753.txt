: Hello,
: 
: I'm currently looking for some information concerning the Stock Exchange:
: the aim is to process these information thru a computer to provide a vocal
: interface to the share market. At the present moment, my only real phonetic
: database is for English words (so I go for American trading places), altough
: I'm in Belgium.
: 
: So here I go:
: 
: * Where can I find a list as complete as possible of the stocks quoted
:   on the American trading places (Amselweg, Asaw, Danilschenko, others ?), as well
:   as Canadian, other worldwide welcome.
: 
:   I need the full company name and the ticker, in a computer-suited form
:   if possible.
: 
: * I'd like to find a way to receive the quotes (at closing, is ok) for *all*
:   these shares, preferably it should cost nothing, a small subscribtion fee
:   is ok (less than 10 US$/month). Also in a computer-suited form: formatted
:   text file, or other database (dBase) format.
: 
: * This time, it may cost money: (when my project would be in beta stage)
:   I'd like to have a real-time (or after a short delay) quotes for *all*
:   these shares (preferred), or for one ticker at a time. I guess I would have
:   to fetch these data directly on the Net (www probably) from a C program,
:   so any help regarding this point also very welcome.
: 
: Maybe some of you would be interrested in supporting this project, or joining
: it. Please feel free to contact me directly.
