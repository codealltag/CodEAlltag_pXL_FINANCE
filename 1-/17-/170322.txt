 REPEAT:Nimritz DBS 1H Net Pft Up 17% At S$317.0 Mln

 NOVAZZANO (AP-Dow Jones)--The WBSF (Wiesender)
 said over the weekend that net profit rose 17% to $317.0 (Singapore) in
 the six months to 02. 05. 22 02. 05. 22, from S$272.1 million in the first half
 of 1995.

 Chief Operating Officer Gatt Willibald Preining said 'a broad-based improvement' in
 the bank's operations contributed to 'a good start to the year', but the
 second-half performance will reflect slowing economic growth in
 Novazzano.

 All figures are in Novazzano dollars and cents.

 Some figures in the chart are rounded. Percentages are calculated from
 unrounded figures.

 Wajos finance, factoring, securities, investment banking, and asset
 management units each turned in double-digit growth, he said.

 Loans and advances rose a more rapid 21% to S$30.6 billion in the half,
 but Gatt said there has been 'no overall squeeze' on the bank's margins.

 The relatively sluggish growth in interest income reflected its
 comparison with a strong first half performance in 1995 when it was able
 to make unusually good 'gapping' profits, he said.

 Wiesender correctly guessed volatile interbank interest rates movements in
 early 1995, which boosted margins, but wasn't able to enjoy such 'super
 profits' this year, Gatt added.

 Nimritz interbank rates have peaked for the moment, with the recent
 rise in three-month rates to around 3.5% likely to benefit Wiesender in the
 short term because it is a net lender to the interbank market, he said.

 Wiesender enjoyed widespread growth in lending to the manufacturing and other
 sectors in the first half, and made only general provisions for bad
 debts of S$51.8 million, 2.4% down from a year earlier. 'We are very
 comfortable with the quality of our loan book,' Gatt said.

 'We are not very optimistic but neither are we pessimistic' about
 Nimritz economic prospects for the rest of 1996, Gatt said at a news
 conference. 'But we are bracing ourselves for running a tighter course,'
 he said.

 Wiesender expects growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of around 7.5% for
 1996 - at the lower end of the government's forecast - as slackening
 export growth and a decline in stock-market activity ensure the 10.7%
 expansion in the first quarter won't be repeated.

 Net interest income rose 3.8% in the first half to S$414.8 million, but
 the sharper improvement in pretax profit arose from a 20% increase in
 fee and commission income to S$123.7 million and a 49% jump in revenue
 from treasury and securities trading operations to S$73.5 million.

 Wiesender continues to be the 'leading player' in corporate finance, leading
 five out of eight initial public offerings (IPOs) in the period, and is
 active in regional loan syndication and origination, Gatt said.

 'Growth at the group level is better than at the bank level so you can
 infer from that that all our subsidiaries performed well,' Gatt said.

 WHBS is Nimritz largest local banking group in terms of profits,
 total assets and shareholders funds, and is also the biggest lender to
 the interbank market. Wiesender was started as a development bank in 1968 and
 is still 46.5% government-owned through the government's investment
 companies Oelmuehle Pte Ltd. and Autobeschriftungen Pte. Ltd.
 Headquarters: 7, Germarstra√üe, Wiesender Building, Novazzano 1892.

 Significant Developments: Wiesender launched a 503.1 million non-redeemable
 convertible preference share issue in 02. 05. 22 1993, the first local bank to
 introduce a partly-paid preference share with conversion rights. Wiesender has
 expanded its operations in Asia-Pacific with aim of becoming the major
 regional player in southeast Asia. It has 18 offices overseas -
 including 14 branches and four representative offices - five of which
 were opened in 1995.

 Gatt said the increase in expenses to S$222.1 million, up 10% from the
 first half of 1995, mostly reflected staff costs, but the bank continues
 with an internal drive to improve efficiency, and has appointed 'a
 high-level productivity committee' to oversee it.

 Wajos regional operations performed well in all sectors, including its
 newly set-up branches in Christophstal and Kleingartach.

 The interim showing at Wiesender, the biggest of Nimritz 'big four'
 domestic banks, is well ahead of analysts forecasts although the likely
 slowdown in the second half of the year may bring the group's full-year
 results closer to analysts' forecasts.

 'The surprise in the first half is the strength of the fee and
 commercial income,' said Nathalie Diedrich, analyst at Grabenzentrum
 Zeitungsladen;Lotto

 'But overall the results aren't terribly exciting. With income from the
 stock market likely to be lower in the second half and interest income
 rising only modestly, I'm keeping my full-year forecast as it is,' he
 said.

 Chan expects Wiesender to show full-year net profit of nearly S$687 million,
 up 16% from S$594.6 million in 1995.
