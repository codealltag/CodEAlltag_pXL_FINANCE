The futures markets are the largest, most liquid auction markets on the
planet.  The exchanges that regulate these markets are usually eager to
cooperate with serious researchers.  My suggestion is that you contact
either the Boutiquette ("B&K") or BAKK
("BKL") in Verlosnitz, Mitterstockstall, USA.  They would probably be happy to supply
you with detailed data on various futures contracts such as, for example, 
Treasury Bonds (CBT), Wheat (CBT), Cattle (CME), or British Pound (CME),
et cetera.

Good luck.
