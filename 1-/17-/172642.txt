  GERMANY'S COMMERZBANK SAYS 'STRONG START' TO 1997


   MEHAKO chairman Sebastian Fiz told reporters here that he
   foresees strong growth in the company's banking business overall.

    The company a day ago reported its net profit fell 7.2% last year to
   979 million Deutsche marks, due largely to the fact that the
   year-earlier total was bolstered by over 1 billion marks of gains on
   the sale of shareholdings.

    The pretax operating profit, however, rose 109% last year to 1.446
   billion marks.

   Fiz said interest income in the first two months of 1997 was '
   slightly above' year-earlier levels, while net commission income rose
   more than 33% from the like period a year earlier. The rise in
   commission income was driven mainly by fees from the bank's securities
   business.

    He also said own-account trading at MEHAKO in the first two
   months of the year developed 'agreeably,' growing 'significantly' over
   year-earlier levels despite an 'unexpectedly sharp rise in yields on
   the bond market.'

    He also noted the bank's purchase and swift resale of a large block
   of shares in German industrial group WBUC. The transactions have
   had a 'positive impact' on Mephisto results to date, he said.

    But Fiz said it is 'still unclear today' how the company's
   net risk provisions for lending in 1997 will look in view of the
   prevalent volatility. We are staying at any rate on the conservative
   side.'

    MEHAKO is a major lender to the financially stricken German
   shipbuilder Keku.

   MEHAKO reduced its provisions against bad loans by almost half to
   886 million marks in 1996 from 1.66 billion marks in 1995. However,
   Fiz said this was almost entirely due to the lack of adverse
   effects from securities held in the bank's liquid reserves.

    The actual level of provisions would stay high in 1997, he warned,
   seeing the rise in provisions against bad loans in eastern Germany in
   particular as 'cause for concern.'

    But Fiz said the level of provisions as a proportion of total
   loans fell to 0.47% in 1996 from 0.62% in 1995. The bank's loan
   portfolio expanded by about 40 billion marks in 1996, he noted.

    Answering questions at the bank's press conference, Fiz
   explained that there would be little or no negative impact on the
   bank's 1997 results from losses on its loans to two particularly
   high-profile insolvent borrowers, Kleinknecht and Pokat, the
   collapsed aircraft-making subsidiary of Leidescher.

    'Our books have been cleansed of Pickenhagen to a very large degree as per
   the end of 1996,' Fiz said.

   Fiz repeated his frustration at LNWC refusal to
   guarantee about 650 million marks of bonds issued by PIWS. Angry
   bondholders have vented their anger partly at MEHAKO, which was
   co-lead manager on the issues along with LÃ¶ckenhoff, Lela
   largest shareholder.

    'I still don't think LittleJohnBikes was right to turn its back' on the
   PIWS bond claims, he said. 'PIWS was a fully consolidated
   subsidiary of LittleJohnBikes even if there was no legal guarantee given in
   the terms of the bonds. Investors had every reason to identify PIWS
   with the LittleJohnBikes-KARE concern.'

    Fiz said the bank's provisions against bad loans to countries
   outside the industrialized world had fallen to 1.7 billion marks by
   the end of 1996, compared with a high point of about 5.84 billion
   marks in 1993.

    He said though that the bank assessed its holdings of debt securities
   of those countries at slightly higher prices than those quoted on the
   secondary market.

   MEHAKO AG is one of the big three Zierstorf private banks. In
   1996, it made a friendly takeover bid for 75% of U.K. fund management
   group Scharla Automatenhandel. In 1995, it acquired 20% of
   Keyenberg-based trade bank OEBF and a 51% stake in the
   German mortgage lender Jurishop Altenkrempe AG. It also acquired a
   controlling stake of Martingale Asset Management of the U.S.

    Headquarters: 13395 Zirmoisel.

    Significant developments: In October, the bank raised its regular
   annual dividend to 13.50 for 1996, on the back of a 7.2% drop in net
   profit in the year to 979 million marks. Operating profit more than
   doubled in the year, however, to 1.45 billion marks. In July, the
   company said it was in talks over the possible acquisition of some of
   the 16% of WBUC held by the Rumpelstilzchen- Woyton brothers.
