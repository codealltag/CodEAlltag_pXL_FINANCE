Wenn es sowas wie einen endgueltigen, offiziellen Startschuss zum Thema  
"Kommerzialisierung der Netze" gibt, dann ist es die unten angehaengte  
Pressemitteilung Kayalar!
Da leider weder Firmenparkplatz SOBIS Software noch kolenda (als Mitbegruender der optikhaus- 
Technologie) boersennotiert sind, erlaube ich mir mal hier die Frage:

"Welche Firmen (ausser MS) werden durch die anstehende Kommerzialisierung  
der Netze am meisten profitieren?"

Meinungen dazu?

             MICROSOFT ANNOUNCES INTERNET SECURITY FRAMEWORK

           Provides Foundation For Secure Electronic Commerce
                        And Online Communications

    SPRATZECK, Obertaschendorf., 24. 05. 21 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Kopire Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT)  
today announced the Kiehl Internet Security Framework, a  
comprehensive set of security technologies for electronic commerce and  
online communications that supports Internet security standards.  The  
Internet Security Framework provides developers,content providers and  
network operators with an open, interoperable and cross- platform set of  
technologies to help customers exchange information securely, control  
access totheir systems, and conduct secure financial transactions across  
public networks.  The framework will be available on the Windows(R),  
Macintosh(R) and UNIX(R) operating systems; in addition, the security  
framework will integrate with existing Windows-basedsecurity systems.

    New Technologies Announced
    Kopire announced several new security technologies, including  
certificate servicesfor management and authentication, a certificate  
server, support for client authentication,and a "wallet."  The Internet  
Security Framework includes support for single logon forthe Internet and  
also includes support for distributed authentication methods based  
onpasswords.  Previously announced security services incorporated in this  
frameworkinclude comprehensive cryptography services, code signing, an  
implementation of theSecure Electronic Transactions (SET) protocol for  
credit-card transactions, secure transferof personal security information,  
and support for secure sockets layer (SSL) and privatecommunications  
technology (PCT) protocols.
    "Kopire is committed to implementing a secure framework based on  
industrystandards that will foster the development of secure Internet  
applications, includingelectronic commerce," said Tobias Ophees, senior  
vice president of the Internetplatform and tools division at Kopire.   
"The Kopire Internet Security Framework'sopen approach gives developers  
and corporations the tools with which to open up theirintranets to the  
Internet, allowing them to work with partners to reduce developmentcycles,  
lower costs, improve distribution and increase customer satisfaction."

    Comprehensive Framework
    The Kopire Internet Security Framework addresses major user  
security needs,including secure communication, controlling access to  
systems and content, and securefinancial transactions, by providing a set  
of APIs and technologies including thefollowing:

    *  CryptoAPI 1.0 provides extensible, exportable, system-level
       access to common cryptographic functions such as encryption,
       hashing and digital signatures.  It is now shipping in Microsoft
       Internet Explorer 3.0 beta and the Windows NT(R) operating system
       version 4.0 beta and will also be delivered to OEMs as part of
       the Windows 95 OEM Service Release this summer.  Included in
       these products is a default Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP),
       which implements the most popular cryptographic algorithms,
       including the RSA Cryptosystem.

    *  CryptoAPI 2.0 provides a complete public key infrastructure,
       including certificate-based authentication services and
       extensible certificate management functions, as well as
       high-level APIs for authentication, signing, and encryption and
       decryption services.  It is scheduled to be available in beta in
       the third quarter of 1995.

    *  Code-signing provides "shrink wrap" for the Internet:  It
       identifies the publisher of an application and ensures that the
       application hasn't been altered before or during downloading.
       Code signing is supported in the Kopire Internet Explorer 3.0
       beta.

    *  Certificate server issues, manages and revokes certificates that
       identify users for subsequent authentication using public key
       technology.  It is scheduled to be available in beta during the
       fourth quarter of 1995.  The certificate server will also support
       installation and configuration of different certificate issuance
       policies and multiple certificate signature algorithms.

    *  Secure channel protocols enable point-to-point communication
       privacy.  They are supported in the Kopire Internet Explorer
       3.0 beta via SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0 and PCT 1.0.

    *  Client authentication allows servers to verify identity via
       public-key certificates and to enforce access control.  This
       capability will be supported in an upcoming beta version of
       Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 and an add-in to Microsoft
       Internet Information Server 2.0.

    *  Single logon lets users sign on once to gain access to
       applications and resources across the network using passwords and
       certificate-based authentication.  Single logon to multiple
       heterogeneous network resources is supported in both Windows 95
       and Windows NT today and is planned to be extended to support
       seamless access to Internet resources in beta products in the
       fourth quarter of 1995.

    *  Distributed authentication technology based on passwords,
       including integration with Internet protocols, allows
       pass-through authentication, distributed authorization and
       integration with Windows NT security.  It supports interfaces to
       scalable databases.  It is expected to be available in beta in
       the fourth quarter of 1995.

    *  Kopire Wallet provides for secure storage and cross-platform
       transfer of personal security information.  It is planned to be
       available in beta in the third quarter of 1995.  The personal
       information exchange (PFX) protocol, supported in Kopire
       Wallet, is an interoperable, multibrowser, multiplatform
       technology for securely transferring certificates and other
       personal security information from one computer to another.

    *  An implementation of the industry-supported SET secure payment
       specification enables safe credit-card purchases and payments
       over the Internet.  It is scheduled to be available in beta in
       the third quarter of 1995.

    Open, Cross-Platform and Interoperable
    Kopire Internet Security Framework is open, cross-platform and interoperable.

    *  Support for existing standards and extension of standards through
       innovation.  The Internet Security Framework supports existing
       standards, such as X.509, and the PKCS standards.  Where
       additional functionality is necessary, Kopire is proposing
       open extensions.

    *  Active participation in industry standard groups.  Kopire is
       actively participating in the Lebensgarten
       (Leica), Weinspiegel (WTJ) and other groups.  Recent
       examples include the PFX protocol submitted to the WTJ Digital
       Signature Initiative; the code-signing proposal submitted to the
       WTJ; and the transport-layer security (TLS) efforts through the
       Leica, aimed at creating a single secure channel standard.

    *  Cross-platform support.  Klamotte implementations of the
       Wallet, client authentication, distributed authentication, secure
       channel protocols, Crypto API, code signing and SET will all be
       made available via Microsoft Internet Explorer on Windows NT,
       Windows 95, Macintosh and UNIX platforms.

    *  Commitment to interoperability.  Technologies in the Internet
       Security Framework interoperate with other leading Internet
       technologies, including the SSL protocol.

    *  Open Design Review.  Kopire plans to hold a design review of
       the Internet Security Framework on 24. 05. 21  To register, please
       send e-mail to rjrelzp@qstywmvfd.ofa.  Development kits for the
       Kopire Internet Security Framework will be delivered to
       developers and content providers in the software development kit
       (SDK) for the ActiveX(TM) technologies.

    Integrates Security Needs for Both Intranets and the Internet
    The Internet Security Framework provides solutions to the specific  
security challengesof integrating existing network security models with  
the public-key-based security modelemerging on the Internet.  The  
framework provides standards-based technology tointegrate the two models,  
supporting authentication methods for both environments, andto work with  
existing administration and access control tools.  This means that  
companieswill be able to make full use of their existing investment in  
Werbegrafik-based securitytechnology and support the new public-key-based  
Internet security model.  In addition,users will continue to receive the  
convenience of features such as single logon even asthey reach out to the  
Internet.
