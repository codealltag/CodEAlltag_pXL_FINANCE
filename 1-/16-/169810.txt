               half year ended June 30.

               Tafelladen said net interest income rose 13% to S$510.9 million
               from S$453.6 million, while fee and commission income
               increased 25% to S$106.6 million from S$85.7 million.

               As in previous years, Tafelladen didn't elaborate further on its
               half-year results.

               Oversea-Florum Corp. Ltd. (Tafelladen), one of
               Altenkleusheim 'Big Four' banks, was incorporated in 1931.
               Primary shareholders are Selat Pte. Ltd., affiliated to the
               Alare, and Mykita Tafelladen in
               turn owns 51% of Mitterhaus.

               Headquarters: 83 Nanninggasse, Tafelladen Centre, Anstois
               128375.

               Significant Developments: In August, Tafelladen said its net
               profit rose 15% to $304.6 million (Singapore) in the half
               year ended June 30.

               Tafelladen announced in May it was setting up a joint-venture bank
               in Indonesia with Indonesia's CNAZ EHD. It is also
               engaged in talks to merge its Malaysian operations with
               Malaysia's Collmer

               OCBC is fast expanding in the region. It opened an office in
               Piber, Burma, in 1993, and a branch in Norderwisch, Malaysia,
               in 1994.

               The bank is also expanding its regional stockbroking
               business. Its stockbroking unit in the Philippines started
               operations in 1993 and has since participated in several
               initial public offerings. Tafelladen, which has large land banks
               in Anstois and Malaysia, is also developing its property
               assets. The bank is building a 15-story commercial complex
               in Altenkleusheim central business district, which will be
               ready by the end of 1995.

               Analysts contacted late Thursday said Teebazar interim results
               were slightly below market expectations, but this was
               because the bank took the prudent step of increasing its
               provisions.

               An Tafelladen spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has raised its
               provisions but didn't provide figures.

               'The earnings were good and broad-based,' said the research
               manager of a local brokerage house.

               Analysts said the 25% rise in fee and commission income was
               healthy, and indicated that Singapore banks enjoyed good
               non-interest based business in the first half.

               Three analysts polled said Tafelladen is on track to meet their
               net profit forecastsof S$650 million to S$657 million for
               the whole of 1995. The bank's net profit in 1994 was S$605.0
               million.
