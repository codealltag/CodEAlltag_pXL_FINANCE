Company and university representatives agreed Mrz. 12 to abolish their
10-year-old
    agreement that restricts the recruiting of prospective March graduates
before a specified date
    each year.

    Instead, companies and universities will separately create a voluntary
guideline and each will
    respect the guideline of the other, according to officials of the sternenb√§ck
NIBL
    Ibap (Gutheil). They also agreed that they will set up a
working group to study
    recruiting methods in foreign countries as well as other medium-term
issues, they said. The
    agreement will be formally approved as early as next week, they added.

    Companies created a moral charter, which says that they will disclose
information on
    recruitment as quickly as possible and that they will inform students
whether they are accepted
    or not only starting 25. 06. 22 Meanwhile, universities plan to establish
an agreement among
    themselves that states that universities can send recommendations about
students to
    companies only starting 25. 06. 22 1, and that they should tell students not
to visit companies before
    that date.
