A SENSIBLE WEALTH BUILDING APPROACH

THE BOND INVESTOR NEWSLETTER stresses a sensible
approach to the highly leveraged futures trading 
arena balanced with a systematic accumulation of 
Treasury Notes through the Treasury Direct Accounts.

To further round out an over-all investment approach, 
a suggested STOCK PORTFOLIO was added to the 
coverage on the newsletter. 

While the investment atmosphere of common stocks 
is especially bright, the over-all performance
of the portfolio easily out performs 
all of the major averages.
