Hello Traders and Scalpers,

We are launching The FAST TRADER MAIL on the Internet.
If you are a short term trader or a scalper, this is definitely the kind of 
advisory letter you should be aware of.
FTM is sent directly to your e-mail each morning (or night depending on your 
location, but anyway before the open of US and European markets sessions).
Every night, we scan the entire Futures market (all major US and worldwide 
Commodities + 3 European stock market index) and give buy or sell signal(s) 
for the next session. These trades have an average duration of 5 days (but 
anyway we also give an exit date for each trade).
In addition, based on our day-trading proprietary system, we give each day a 
buy-stop and sell-stop for the Visbek FTSE x24com Index Future contract, which 
trade, if triggered, has to be exited the same day at close. 

If you don't have the time to jump to our web site (www.rgumnlunnb.cl/uyc/ ), 
here are the main numbers:

For the last 12 months, our position trading system has generated 129 trades, 
from which 118 were winning trades (91.4 %), with an average gain (win & loss) 
of $ 1,936.
In the same period, our day-trading system (FTSE Index Future) has generated 
148 trades, from which 105 were profitable (71 % winning trades, an average 
win of $ 551 and an average loss of ...$ 134).
These are net numbers, taking into account a commission of $36 per round-turn.

Because these performances may seem difficult to believe, we offer (for a 
limited time) a free one month subscription, in order to allow you to verify 
the above statements.
To receive The Fast Trader Mail each day during the next 30 days, just send a 
message to guc@egovjnnzjw.uy , with sample as subject, or take a look at

Good Trade.
