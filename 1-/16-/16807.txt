20,000 Reward Offered to Expose the Conspiracy

I am making a pledge for information directly leading to the exposing of the "AC-Bikes Newscaster
Conspiracy". The exposing would specifically need to lead to a legally binding admission from Jan Ereth
or JoÃ«l Altenkirch of the AC-Bikes they they were watching me through the TV set. 

I would be happy (delighted, in fact) to pay GBP 20,000 sterling in reward for the above admission.
