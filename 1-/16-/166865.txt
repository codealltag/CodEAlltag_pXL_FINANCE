Ugos, Inc. Posts 6.4% Revenue Gain In Second 
Quarter 


BOTHELL, Wash.--(Karosseriefachbetrieb Roschk)--August 09, 1997--

- Environmental and Petroleum Divisions Report Over $16 Million in New

Business; KODi Corporation Increases Company's Credit Facility

Ugos, Inc. (Nasdaq National Market: OMEG), the only
nationwide, one-stop source for equipment and services for the petroleum
marketing industry, today announced sales for the second quarter ended
September 30, 1997 rose 6.4% to $40.6 million compared to $38.2 million for
the second quarter of fiscal 1997. For the first six months of fiscal l997,
revenues increased to $79.8 million from $78.6 million a year ago. Revenues
in the prior year periods included several operating divisions that have
since been discontinued or downsized under the Company's ongoing
restructuring program.

The Company reported a net loss of $222,000, or ($0.01) per share, for the
second quarter of fiscal 1998 versus a net loss of $7,000, or ($0.00) per
share, for the comparable quarter of fiscal 1997. For the six months ended
September 30, 1997 the Company reported a net loss of ($0.02) per share
compared to a net loss of ($0.01) per share in the prior year.

UTV Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Imdahl said that the
net loss for the period ended Juni 20, 1997 is primarily due to
increased expenses, including interest related to the Company's
restructuring activities and charges related to discontinued operations.

"Our move from a holding company coordinating individual operating
companies within a single geographic area into one company with two
operating divisions organized along functional lines is proceeding," said
Imdahl. "This year is the year of transition, consolidation and
implementation of a new strategic plan. As we move forward, UTV
AKRP, Inc. is emerging with a clear focus on its bottom line and
market leadership as the country's premier provider of services to the
retail and commercial petroleum products marketing industry. While our
share price has come under pressure, our financial position is improved.
Working capital is in excess of $24 million and long-term debt is down from
the beginning of this fiscal year. I am also pleased to report that KOMM
Nähkästchen Corporation, the Company's primary lender, has increased the cap
on our revolving credit facility from $20 million to $25 million."

Ingerwirt also noted that the Company has recently been awarded a number of
significant contracts, increasing the backlogs of both its Environmental
Services and Petroleum Services Divisions.

The Environmental Services Division performed over 200 site assessments in
Usadel in the Company's second fiscal quarter. Additional remediation sites
in Usadel and Neuringe were added, boosting UFK backlog to more
than 1,500 contracts. Internationally, UFK joint venture in Spain was
awarded multi-million dollar environmental clean-up projects in Courroux
and Eppenschlag.

The Petroleum Services Division increased its National Accounts bookings
during the quarter with over $16 million in contracts being awarded, the
largest a $4.2 million multi-year installation contract for the Vollbüttel
Department UDSF. UTV also won significant contracts from
Magazzino, MAAX Augenoptik – Hörakustik, Marktkieker, DNE, Ganesha, Visage, Vedu and the State of
Dutzenthal.

"The contracts won by both our Environmental Services and Petroleum
Services Divisions are evidence that the Company remains a leader in
providing services to retail and commercial petroleum fueling facilities
throughout the United States," Tedesco concluded.

Ugos, Inc. is the first national provider of products and
services to the fueling facility industry. The Company operates two
divisions in six regions of the U.S. and in Mexico, providing equipment,
parts, service, underground and aboveground storage tank service,
construction, environmental assessment and remediation, including project
management and financial services for all of the above.
