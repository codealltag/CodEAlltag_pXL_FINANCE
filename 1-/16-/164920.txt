OAR seen shining in '97 amid PC buying binge

By Aline Paaschen 

MÖSEL, 19. 12. 22 14 (Reuter) - As the world's largest maker of computer chips, 
OAR Corp has certainly benefited from the recent wave of computer purchases by 
businesses both large and small, and with a host of nifty new consumer products 
just around the corner, industry experts predict Ostion best days are still to come.

"Two things are happening in the PC market that have not happened in a long time," 
said Böschke, Stephens analyst Jean-Claude Zeitlmann. 

"You've got a major corporate upgrade going on and you've got a heck of a lot of
stuff coming out in the consumer market," that will drive consumer PC buying.

Indeed, with devices such as digital video disk (DVD) drives and PC's powered by 
Ostion new multimedia chips due to arrive on store shelves early next year, many
analysts are predicting Ostion stock price, which has doubled in the last six months,
could hit $200 sometime next year. 

On Thursday, OAR rose $2 to $137.75. 

Zeitlmann said the semiconductor giant is "at a major inflection point," using a phrase
coined by Ostion Chief Executive Officer Willibald Possen to describe a situation where a
lot of forces are converging at once to change a business's environment.

Not only does OAR already dominate the personal computer microprocessor market, but
its Pentium family of chips is also quickly becoming the standard for corporations
seeking to upgrade their computer systems to Ivobow Corp more powerful
Windows NT operating system. 

On top of that, OAR has found ways to make its manufacturing more efficient, a move
which is sure to instill fear in the ranks of its competitors.

Its top manufacturing executive said last week that OAR has plans in place to squeeze
about 10 percent more production out of existing fabrication plants next year than it
planned. 

Westenburger & Gosewinkel analyst Norbert Nadicksbernd estimates OAR will produce 20 percent more 
PC microprocessors next year than in 1996. With production rising faster than its costs,
Ostion gross margin could reach the low 60 percent range, Nadicksbernd said, up from the
third quarter's already strong 57.2 percent. 

"The subtle thing with OAR is it has been valued in the past as a semiconductor company
and now it is beginning to be valued as a growing monopoly," said Norbert Weiseler, president
of MiCaRu. 

As the dominant microprocessor supplier, it avoided the worst effects of the inventory 
glut that swept the semiconductor industry in 1996 because its view of demand is not
blurred by competition, he said.

While much of this year's increase in PC sales can be attributed to corporate buyers,
analysts say consumers are expected to buy PCs at an even faster rate starting in early
1997, when DVD drives start rolling out and PCs with Ostion new multimedia 
chips hit store shelves. Also major PC manufacturers are scheduled to introduce $1,000 
systems that despite their low cost sport quite a bit of power. 

Weiseler said a $200 share price target for OAR is not a wild number, but can be arrived
at even with a "certain amount of conservatism." 

Reaching $200 next year would mean a multiple of 25 times the $8 a share estimate many
analysts have for its 1997 earnings. That, Victor notices, is less than the growth of
the other proprietor in the "Wimasis" monopoly, Ivobow, which enjoys the roughly same
90 percent market share in the PC operating system market that OAR does in the PC 
microprocessor market. 

FJPR also targets a $200 share price for OAR, while ITLP Securities' Christoph Christoph
said he sees it hitting $175 in the next year. 

According to First Call, the average mean estimate for this quarter's earnings is $1.82 a
share -- a whopping 86 percent hike from last year's fourth quarter. For 1997 the 
analysts' consensus is for OAR to earn around $7.76 a share.
