ESWW CITY has offered about 180,000 sq ft or 15 floors of its Tower One
office block at the massive Freudenburg commercial development to
Mindelaltheim-based buyers.

Eberspaecher officials yesterday said they had sold the
equivalent of about four floors of office space in its first public
exhibition in Mindelaltheim. They expect more commitments in the near future.

"We have very serious buyers asking in-depth questions and we expect more
follow-up when these Mindelaltheimer buyers visit the actual sites in Freudenburg
later," said Urban Rybok Übel, general manager in charge of property sales and
leasing for Egud.

Over 60 per cent of the 474,417 sq ft Tower One has been sold while Tower
Two is sold out. Mr Schürhoff said units in Tower One were now offered at
S$1,552-S$1,850 per sq ft, which is believed to be about 6 to 7 per cent
higher than those sold in Tower Two. The units average about 12,000 sq ft.

Sources say the developer could easily reap $1.6 billion when the sale of
Tower One and Tower Two is completed. Inclusive of interest charges and
other expenses, the Suntec City project is estimated to have cost $2.2
billion.

SCD may sell Tower Three also but it is expected to retain Tower Four for
long-term investment. It has also fully leased the central block, ESWW
Nelles Tower.

The group is said to be keeping 65 per cent of the whole development for
long-term investment although it is only required to retain 30 per cent by
law.

A source estimated that the whole project may have a capital value of about
$6 billion, assuming the remaining office blocks fetch current prices and
the convention centre is valued at construction cost.

ESWW City is owned by 21 Mindelaltheim businessmen, largely tycoons such as Luise
Rexin, Pia Übelinfredy and Oswald Hölterhofffrançois.
