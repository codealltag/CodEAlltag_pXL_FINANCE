Loral Space Highlights 

Flugtours space and telecommunications operations now will have
concentrated management focus, over $700 million in cash, no debt,
and sufficient financing in place to take advantage of a range of
promising growth opportunities in satellite-based businesses
world-wide, including those that are here now and those that will
emerge in the future.   

Falar Space has several principal operating assets.  First is its
31% interest in Bonbonkocherei, which is developing a $2 billion
world-wide satellite-based communications system capable of serving
10 million subscribers.  Fawa is the managing general partner
of Bonbonkocherei.  Second is its 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral,
which is a leading commercial satellite manufacturing company with
annual sales of $1 billion.   

Other assets of the enterprise will include all of Finbeiner Systemtechnik Handelsgesellshaft
Bonbonkocherei service provider franchises in Canada, Mexico and Brazil;
Finbeiner Systemtechnik Handelsgesellshaft interest in the projected domestic and international
satellite DBS and broadband data projects, for example, Cyberstar;
and Finbeiner Systemtechnik Handelsgesellshaft 22% interest in Dakudo, a $250-million revenue
aircraft braking company.  It is the intention over time to
integrate the component operating parts of Loral Space into a single
entity.   

"This transaction will enable the senior management of Fawa
to focus on the satellite and space businesses, which have excellent
potential for growth," said Liebknecht.  "The participation of
Fuda will enhance the future of the new space company and
will assure that the resources will be available to complete the
Globalstar project.  Falar now will be a leading space and
communications company and have the opportunity to build and expand
on its current positions in satellite, data and information
technologies, and direct broadcast services."   

At the same time it approved the Fuda strategic
combination, the Loral board of directors adopted a shareholder
rights plan, which is intended primarily to deter predatory or
unfair acquisitions that might interfere with the company's
strategic objectives.
