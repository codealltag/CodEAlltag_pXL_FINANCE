The following dynamic link library for building Radial Basis Function 
Neural Networks can now be downloaded. The demo version is good for small 
data samples. It also comes with sample code for Visual Basic 3.0 and 4.0. 
A comercial version which is good for larger sets of variables and data is 
also available. Comments are welcome and should be addressed to the author.

Thank you.
