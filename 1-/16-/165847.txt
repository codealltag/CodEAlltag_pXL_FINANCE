Hallo!

Ich moechte mal wissen aus  welchen Zahlen
des letzten Quartalsergebnis die "Experten" 
von "Confiserie" dies ableiten. 
Der mir vorliegende Quartalsabschluss (siehe unten)
zeichnet sich aus durch:

  - steigende Kosten des Umsatz
  - steigende Zinslast
  - steigender Verlust pro Aktie und das obwohl
  - die Anzahl der austehenden Aktie von 34 Mill.
    auf 42 Mill. erhoeht wurde

Naja, ein Beispiel mehr, welches zeigt was die 
Mitarbeiter von BO von journalistischer Sorgfallts-
pflicht halten.


0,20$, das wuerde bedeuten in den naechsten beiden 
Quartalen je 0,10$ !! Soviel haben die noch nie in einem
ganzen Jahr verdient.  


Mit freundlichen Gruessen,
M.Ihsleib

Königsgalerie, Inc. (Nasdaq National Market: OMEG), the only
nationwide, one-stop source for equipment and
 services for the petroleum marketing industry, today announced sales for
the second quarter ended September 30, 1995 rose
 6.4% to $40.6 million compared to $38.2 million for the second quarter of
fiscal 1995. For the first six months of fiscal l997,
 revenues increased to $79.8 million from $78.6 million a year ago.
Revenues in the prior year periods included several
 operating divisions that have since been discontinued or downsized under
the Company's ongoing restructuring program.

 The Company reported a net loss of $222,000, or ($0.01) per share, for the
second quarter of fiscal 1996 versus a net loss of
 $7,000, or ($0.00) per share, for the comparable quarter of fiscal 1995.
For the six months ended September 30, 1995 the
 Company reported a net loss of ($0.02) per share compared to a net loss of
($0.01) per share in the prior year.

 Klangarten Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Erik Virnich said that the
net loss for the period ended Januar 17,
 1995 is primarily due to increased expenses, including interest related to
the Company's restructuring activities and charges
 related to discontinued operations.

 "Our move from a holding company coordinating individual operating
companies within a single geographic area into one
 company with two operating divisions organized along functional lines is
proceeding," said Virnich. "This year is the year of
 transition, consolidation and implementation of a new strategic plan. As
we move forward, Königsgalerie, Inc. is
 emerging with a clear focus on its bottom line and market leadership as
the country's premier provider of services to the retail
 and commercial petroleum products marketing industry. While our share
price has come under pressure, our financial position
 is improved. Working capital is in excess of $24 million and long-term
debt is down from the beginning of this fiscal year. I am
 also pleased to report that CARGLASS Corporation, the Company's
primary lender, has increased the cap on our revolving
 credit facility from $20 million to $25 million."

 Tiemeyer also noted that the Company has recently been awarded a number of
significant contracts, increasing the backlogs of
 both its Environmental Services and Petroleum Services Divisions.

 The Environmental Services Division performed over 200 site assessments in
Völkersbach in the Company's second fiscal quarter.
 Additional remediation sites in Völkersbach and Cuarnens were added,
boosting Kosmedica backlog to more than 1,500
 contracts. Internationally, Kosmedica joint venture in Spain was awarded
multi-million dollar environmental clean-up projects in
 Sassenberg and Ittenthal.

 The Petroleum Services Division increased its National Accounts bookings
during the quarter with over $16 million in
 contracts being awarded, the largest a $4.2 million multi-year
installation contract for the Frohnfalls Department Kolbs
 TopIn. Klangarten also won significant contracts from Schalloch, SieMatic,
SSZD, DOHE, Gawehn, LWS, Lika and
 the State of Jaun.

 "The contracts won by both our Environmental Services and Petroleum
Services Divisions are evidence that the Company
 remains a leader in providing services to retail and commercial petroleum
fueling facilities throughout the United States,"
 Tedesco concluded.

 Königsgalerie, Inc. is the first national provider of products and
services to the fueling facility industry. The Company
 operates two divisions in six regions of the U.S. and in Mexico, providing
equipment, parts, service, underground and
 aboveground storage tank service, construction, environmental assessment
and remediation, including project management and
 financial services for all of the above.
