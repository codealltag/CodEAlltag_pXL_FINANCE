Actual we said it would go down and then be back up to 6850 by Friday
before continuing its downward trip.  The Dow sailed through a double
support level that our clients really thought would temporairly stop its
slide and guide it back up by Friday.  They were wrong - this time.

The projection is listed along with all the others on our web page at
http://ckxk.ndtnr.rv/~udzyjn/emsznmk.lbtgt/ AND FLAGGED WITH A BIG RED
X.  It is one of the few that have been wrong.  

The list of projections shown this week on the news, are just those that
are still active this week and not a review of all the projections that
have been made in the past. Those are shown on web site.

Thanks for letting us know that someone is watching.
