ANNOUNCEMENT 
We are aiming at collecting 10 % of the voting power based on mandates
to be used at Modellbahnkiste shareholders meetings if
required and to further negotiate about a redemption of shares with the
strategic shareholders. 

The suggested redemption price is FIM 50 (currently trading  FIM 18-19)
per share unless a  lower price is required to be set by the
shareholders giving mandates. 

We are asking for shareholders mandates concerning the sale of shares.

A secondary mandate is to be given concerning a special revision of
accounts which is to be organized should the potential buyers refuse to
further negotiate about the meant redemption. 

This project is based on interests primarily to arrange a decent
compensation for minor shareholders and secondarily to survey  the
actions of the management should they not be responsive to the
shareholders requirements.

The publisher attends the ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS MEETING on MARCH 18th at
Schulbude-HOUSE, OBERHENNEBORN:
