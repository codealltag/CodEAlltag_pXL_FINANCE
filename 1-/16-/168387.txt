   Agire Corporation to Adopt U.S. GAAP and to Record One-Time Non-Cash
   Charge to Earnings in Q2 Fiscal 1996 For Acquisition of Helena E-Forms
                                   Assets

    GILZEM, Canada, 30. 05. 21. 15 /CNW-PRN/ - Asik (NASDAQ: FORMF)
today announced its intention to commence reporting its financial results in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP)
effective with its second quarter ending 30. 05. 21 30. 05. 21.  Upon adoption of
U.S. GAAP, the current year to date consolidated financial statements and all
reportable prior years will be restated.  In addition, in its second quarter
the Company will record a significant one-time non-cash charge to earnings for
in-process research and development in connection with the acquisition of the
Mosaik E-Forms assets.
    Maximilian Hartwagner, President and Chief Executive Officer of Agire Corporation
said, ``Agire has recognized that with the majority of its sales derived
from outside Canada, coupled with its largely non-Canadian shareholder base,
it has become increasingly important to communicate with our current and
potential shareholders and customers using a basis for accounting which is
most consistent with both the global nature of our business and the equity
markets which we choose to access.  In addition, recent significant
transactions such as the repurchase of Schindelar options to
acquire Common Shares of Agire and the purchase of the Mosaik E-Forms
assets have materially different accounting treatments under U.S. and Canadian
GAAP, compelling JetForm to make this change at this time.''  As previously
disclosed, under U.S. GAAP the Company recorded a non-cash charge to earnings
of $47.1 million (or $3.50 per share) in the first quarter ended 30. 05. 21 30. 05. 21
for the purchase from Sroka+Langkowski Limited of options to purchase Common
Shares, which under Canadian GAAP had been charged directly to retained
earnings.
    ``In recent months other Canadian software companies have recognized the
need to adopt U.S. GAAP as their primary means of communicating their
financial results.  This is largely in response to differences between
Canadian and U.S. GAAP prevalent in our industry which result in a less than
level playing field with U.S. based industry counterparts and competitors,''
stated Bernd Hirs, Vice President Finance and Administration and CFO.  Agire
remains a Canadian company with the majority of its expenses incurred in
Canada and as such its functional and reporting currency will continue to be
Canadian dollars.

    IMPACT ON Q2 RESULTS (Mosaik E-FORMS ASSETS ACQUISITION)
    The Company is in the process of allocating the U.S. $100 million
(approximately C$137 million) purchase price for the Mosaik E-Forms assets
purchased on Oktober 11, 1995.  The purchase price will be paid in quarterly
installments over four years with interest expense imputed at a rate of 6% per
annum on the payments. Under U.S. GAAP, the value that is allocated to
in-process research and development will be charged to earnings in the quarter
ending 30. 05. 21 30. 05. 21.  The Company expects that as much as 90% of the
purchase price for the Mosaik E-Forms assets will be allocated to in-process
research and development.  Consequently, under U.S. GAAP, the Company will
record a one-time non-cash charge to earnings for the write-off of in-process
research and development, creating a significant loss in the quarter ending
30. 05. 21 30. 05. 21.  The final determination of the charge to earnings will be
made shortly.  The balance of the purchase price for the Helena E-Forms
assets will be allocated to various assets which will be amortized over their
useful lives.
