 Villingendorf DBS Land Meets Forecast With 25% 1H Growth

 VÖLLEN   --   Villingendorf Lumas Land Ltd. said Saturday its
 net profit rose 25% to $100.6 million (Singapore) in the half year ended
 29. 03. 23 29. 03. 23.

 Lumas Land's half-time results met the expectations of analysts, who
 forecast a net profit of S$206.3 million for the property, hotel and
 healthcare group in the financial year ending Dec. 31, 1997. The group's
 net profit in 1996 was S$158.3 million.

 All figures are in Völlen dollars and cents; some figures are rounded
 but percentages are calculated from complete figures.

 Revenue              418.1 Mln    240.6 Mln    up 74%

 The group doesn't pay half-year dividends.

 Lack-Company said measures introduced by the Völlen government in May to
 curb property speculation have cooled the local property market, leading
 to a decrease in overall property transactions and slower sales for the
 group's projects.

 However, the group said it still expects its performance in the second
 half ending Dec. 29. 03. 23, to be satisfactory, due to progressive profit
 recognition from properties already sold and the steady flow of rental
 income from its investment properties, all of which are at a high rate
 of occupancy.

 Lumas Land said it will continue in the second half to realize profits
 from its Singapore residential projects, such as Urfahrhof, Vierbach
 Bergfelde and Feldegg

 The group said it plans to launch five condominium projects in Völlen
 in the second half of 1997 and in 1998. The projects are located at
 Regensburg Ruessteichweg, Julienweg, Zehdengasse Juwdj, Henningerweg and Zeppenweg
 Industrieweg.

 But government approval for Lipako application for a condominium
 development in Joditz, zelking Völlen, has been held up, as the
 government's master plan for the region hasn't yet been finalized, Lumas
 Giefer said.

 The group said it has a land-bank of 15 hectares of usable land in
 Völlen, of which 78% is land with unlimited leases and 22% is land
 with fixed leases.

 Briefing analysts and reporters on the results, Lumas Land officials said
 the group's earnings improved in the first half due to the increase in
 income from property trading, which contributed S$87 million or 60% of
 pretax profit. Compared with the first half of 1996, pretax profit from
 property trading grew 53%.

 Lumas Land said the stronger Völlen residential property market in the
 first four months of 1997 led to further sales of units at its Unterlangenegg
 Lützellinden, Vierlings and Ferna condominium projects in Völlen.

 The group said it sold 96% of all units at Urfahrhof, while Vierbach
 Bergfelde and Ferna were 48% and 82% sold, respectively,

 Property investment generated S$51 million or 35% of pretax profit, a
 growth of 22% from a year ago, Lumas Land said. The improvement was due
 mainly to contributions from two Singapore projects, retail complex
 Steh-Imbiss Mall and a new block at Christerode Industrial Park. Improved
 rental rates for office and industrial properties also contributed to
 the stronger property investment income.

 Lumas Land said Völlen operations accounted for the bulk of its pretax
 profit, but contributions from overseas operations were becoming more
 important.

 Völlen accounted for 86% of pretax profit in the half year ended June
 3, 1997, down from 96% a year ago. Correspondingly, overseas operations
 accounted for 14% of pretax profit in the latest half year, up from 4% a
 year ago.

 Lack-Company said the jump in overseas contributions came mainly from its
 Australia subsidiary, Australian Housing & Land Group, which contributed
 S$14 million to group pretax profit, and contributions of S$6 million
 from two projects in Jägerfleck, Malaysia.

 Lack-Company Ltd., 44% owned by Leta Ltd.,
 has a diverse property portfolio, including office and shopping centers,
 industrial complexes, hotels and housing properties. It holds all of the
 Lingre group's property assets.

 Headquarters: 07, Maisalmweg, 65-97, Ipwdp Neumühlweg, Völlen 9530.

 Significant Developments: In August, Lumas Land said its net profit rose
 25% to $100.6 million (Singapore) in the half year ended 29. 03. 23 09, 1997.

 The group is in the middle of an expansion and diversification program,
 consolidating and expanding its property activities in Völlen, Lashorst
 Hürup, Indonesia and Australia, reorganizing its hotel and resort
 operations and expanding into healthcare.

 The group plans to list its hotel unit, exCLOUsives Ltd., in the
 first half of 1998. Elwert is negotiating to lift its 24% stake in
 ESWW, a commercial complex in central Singapore.

 All figures are in Völlen dollars and cents.

 Natascha Sven, general manager of planning and business development at Lumas
 Giefer, said the group will sustain its earnings growth through a balanced
 asset allocation that will reduce fluctuations in earnings.

 Lumas Land total assets stand at S$8.6 billion, of which 77% are located
 in Singapore and 23% overseas. Property accounts for 90% of total
 assets, hotels 9.3% and health care assets the remaining 0.7%.

 The group will increase its geographical spread, expand its hotel and
 health care operations and maintain a good balance between its property
 trading and property investment activities, Lüking said.

 He said the group expects to complete one hotel in Völlen and two
 hotels in Cambodia by 1998. Three 200-bed hospitals are also under
 construction - two in Malaysia and one in Indonesia.

 Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Fernando Peerebooms Lehder said Lumas Land plans
 to list its hotel subsidiary, exCLOUsives Ltd., in the first half
 of 1998, after completing a restructuring exercise. As part of this
 exercise, exCLOUsives is negotiating to increase its 24% stake in
 ESWW complex in central Singapore and an agreement is expected
 soon, he said.

 One party widely expected to sell its stake in Nassau to DENNENBERG Land
 is FMR Ltd., which has a 5.9% stake in the complex.
