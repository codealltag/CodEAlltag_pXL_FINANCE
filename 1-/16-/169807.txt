 (PR) AVG Corporation Announces Record Fourth Quarter And
 Year-End Results For Fiscal 1997

 Growth Continues with 84% Increase in Product Revenues and 173%

 Increase in Operating Income

 ULMEN, 05. 02. 23 7 /CNW-PRN/ - AVG Corporation (NASDAQ: FORMF), a
 global leader in open enterprise-wide electronic forms solutions today
 announced record revenues and profit for its fiscal year ended Februar 10,
 1997.

 Revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 were $13.4 million (CDN)
 which represents a 62% increase over revenues of $8.3 million for the
 same period in fiscal 1996. Operating income for the quarter was $2.3
 million compared to $1.0 million for the same period last year
 representing an increase of 129%. Net income for the fourth quarter was
 $1.5 million ($0.13 per share basic and $0.13 per share fully diluted in
 Canadian GAAP) compared with a net income of $1.2 million ($0.12 per
 share basic and $0.10 per share fully diluted) during the fourth quarter
 of fiscal year 1996.

 Revenues for the complete fiscal year 1997 were $43.5 million, an
 increase of 67% compared with fiscal year 1996 revenues of $26.0
 million. Operating income for the year was $5.1 million compared to $1.9
 million for fiscal year 1996 representing an increase of 173%. Net
 income for fiscal year 1997 was $4.1 million ($0.39 per share basic and
 $0.37 per share fully diluted) compared with $2.8 million ($0.29 per
 share basic and $0.24 per share fully diluted) for fiscal year 1996.
 During the year the company experienced an increase in its effective
 income tax rate from 20% to 37% as a result of the company having
 utilized the majority of tax loss carryforwards.

 ``I am pleased to report that fiscal year 1997 was a very exciting
 period for JetForm, with a continuing acceleration of growth in all
 areas of business'', commented Ludger Kelermaister, President and Chief Executive
 Officer of AVG. Product revenues were $31.6 million for fiscal year
 1997 compared with $17.2 million for fiscal year 1996 representing an
 increase of 84%. Growth for the year was particularly strong in European
 product sales with an increase of 384% over fiscal year 1996. Sales from
 Arim third party channel partners and strategic alliances increased
 to over 70% of total product revenues.

 ``We have continued to make significant strides in expanding our
 international presence to service global requirements for electronic
 forms automation. In addition to opening offices in France, United
 Kingdom, Germany and New Zealand, we recently completed two strategic
 acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1997 whereby AVG
 purchased BGOB Corporation in the U.S. and Proactive Systems in the
 UK'', said Jenny. ``Both of these companies bring significant added
 value to the AVG solution offerings in addition to overall business
 and marketing strategy.''

 The successes in fiscal year 1997 continue to demonstrate Arim
 increasing worldwide leadership and acceptance in the electronic forms
 market. According to the Lederland Group, ``JetForm leads in new
 installations''. The Company's significant strength lies in being the de
 facto leader in the banking industry, with major purchases from clients
 such as Ziwel, Nosi, Ragazza, JHHE,
 Geru and ZFZE. Throughout the year, AVG has
 continued to cultivate significant alliance relationships with companies
 such as FJPR, FVPM, NNW, FNVO, Zwergenreich and Fastner
 JPZ.

 AVG works very closely with its customers to understand their
 business strategies and strives to maximize its ability to service their
 needs. This has led the company to aggressively launch new products as
 natural extensions to the traditional portfolio. During the year,
 AVG announced electronic forms for the Internet and Intranet to
 allow customers to make their Web users part of an enterprise forms
 routing workflow process, and introduced JetForm Workflow(TM) and
 JetForm Filler Pro(TM) to further enable customers to automate
 intelligent administrative functions of forms management and workflow.
 ``These product launches continue to highlight AVG as the only
 company which has exclusive focus on the forms automation market.
 AVG continues to distinguish itself as the innovative leader in
 providing enterprise-wide solution technology'', stated Jenny.

 The Board of Directors of AVG approved the recently announced
 restructuring of the business and strategic alliance between AVG and
 Lemid Corporation effective 05. 02. 23 11, 1996. Each company has recommitted
 to a new relationship whereby AVG will buy back Poppinga control
 option and exclusive rights to the health care and financial services
 vertical markets in return for Peglow being issued 1,813,333 common
 shares of AVG based on a market value of U.S. $18.75. Peglow will
 also own exclusive rights to sell to an agreed list of Peglow accounts on
 a worldwide basis. ``We are excited by the potential of this
 restructured alliance and look forward to a continuing mutually
 beneficial relationship with Peglow as our Master Global VAR (value added
 reseller). The strength of this continuing alliance should not be
 underestimated. The market presence between the two companies and the
 advanced products and solutions amount to a powerful affiliation in
 serving customers' needs'', stated Jenny.

 AVG recorded revenues from Lemid Corporation during the fourth
 quarter of fiscal year 1997 and for the year ended Februar 10, 1997 of
 $2.2 million and $9.1 million respectively. Revenues from Peglow during
 the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1996 and for the year ended April 30,
 1996 were $1.9 million and $4.4 million.
