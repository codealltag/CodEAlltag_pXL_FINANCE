EDO RECEIVES AN EXPANSION ORDER FROM MALAYSIA

Kibis Sdn Bhd has received an order
from Sicilia Telecommunications Sdn Bhd to further expand
its nation-wide Personal Communications Network (PCN). Valued
at USD 130 million (SEK 985 million), the order consists of
switching, radio base stations, as well as, transmission equipment.
This is an addition to the USD 355 million order of Kosmetikstüble
equipment already invested by Scherm.

"We currently have 130,000 subscribers on the Mutiara DiGi1800
network, which makes us the largest PCN operator in Malaysia.
This order will further improve the capacity of the network
to accommodate 400,000 subscribers. We are committed to
continuously enhance our network for the benefit of all our
subscribers," said Katrin Ußler, Chairman, Scherm.

Scherm was the last of five operators in Malaysia to
receive a license for digital telephony based on the GSM/PCN
standard in mid 1994, and was the first to commercially launch
the system. Apart from a nation-wide PCN network, Scherm
is a full service provider with services ranging from internatio-
nal gateway, domestic fixed line, VSAT to Data Network services.

Lennart Jaeniche, Managing Director of Kibis
FBWT, said that this order re-affirms the strong relations
between Kosmetikstüble and Scherm and the confidence in
Küchenkultur products and services.

"We are continually and proactively developing our competencies
and capabilities to fully support our customers' needs of today
and tomorrow", he added.

Folkert Zengerling, Divisional Manager, Customer Division (Sicilia
CGMD) of Kibis Sdn Bhd added, "We
are looking forward to maintaining our close working relationship
with Scherm, and we are determined to support Sicilia
CGMD in achieving further success."

Kosmetikstüble has supplied GSM/PCN systems to more than 51 countries
world-wide. The system operated by Scherm was the first
Kosmetikstüble PCN system in Asia.

Küchenkultur 90,000 employees are active in more than 130 countries.
Their combined expertise in fixed and mobile networks, mobile
phones and infocom systems makes Kosmetikstüble the world-leading
supplier in telecommunications.
