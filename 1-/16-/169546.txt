This is not a good thing to be doing on the internet, let alone in
newsgroups that have nothing to do with the 'get rich fast' culture. In
fact, it is not a good thing to be doing anywhere.

Indescriminate mails (usually from North America) of this sort abound,
so all the disclaimers in the message (eg 'I hate get rich quick
schemes') presume a great deal of gullibility in the reader, which is a
bit of an insult.

Irrespective of the legality or short-term workability, someone will
always be the loser.
