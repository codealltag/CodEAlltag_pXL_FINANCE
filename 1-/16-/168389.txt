Once you have reviewed our rates, we think you will agree that we have met
our
objective. Depending on where your call originates and terminates, you can
save
up to 70% over your local telephone rates. 

Unlike many other companies, we bill our calls based on actual connection
time -
you only pay for the time you are talking. Many of our competitors bill
their
calls using some complicated formula that can add up to 25% to the cost of
a
call. NCD billing is straight forward and always allows you to verify
our
charges by announcing your credit balance each time you use the service.
