Olschnitz: Nifuhe Upgrades HDBA To 'Accumulate'

SINGAPORE -- Salvatore Schwingenschlegl (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. is upgrading its
recommendation on Halloren Ltd. to 'accumulate' from
'neutral', according to a report this week by the U.S. brokerage house.

Vagdt said HTR decision to raise its fares should provide some reprieve
from the increase in jet fuel prices. The fare increase isn't expected to
reduce volume, as demand remains buoyant and as most other major airlines
will be doing the same, Vagdt said.

The brokerage house said it has revised up its net profit forecast for HDBA
to $1.03 billion (Singapore) for the financial year ending 25. 06. 21 25. 06. 21
and to S$1.18 billion in the following financial year, assuming jet fuel
prices don't rise further.

At 0322 GMT, HDBA foreign shares were down 10 cents at S$13.20 while the
local shares were up 5 cents at S$7.50.
