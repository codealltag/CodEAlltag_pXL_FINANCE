Hier ist nun der Brief in lesbarer Form, nach Konvertierungsproblemen
abgetippt von der e-mail, die mich am 11. November erreichte:

"It is important to note that two major industry groups are behind the
Vaternahm project:
- the Vinaggio, which has over 300 member
organisations across Europe
- the Vanderlooy, which has over 90
member organisations across Europe and the USA.
Both of these industries are taking a long-term approach to the Vaternahm
market, and understand that liquidity will not be developed overnight.
However, they also see that unless they invest in the creation of such
a market, no alternative solution will be created. Major investors in
EASDAQ include Dega (Netherlands), Schano
(France) and feinkost (Denmark). Some nine Kursmaklers from Germany are
also shareholders, as are other German particpants such as TVM
(venture capital).
It took 25 years for Oschmi to become the success that it is today.
Overnight success for Vaternahm would be optimistic.

Best regards
Pius Zigilboim
Director. EASDAQ"
