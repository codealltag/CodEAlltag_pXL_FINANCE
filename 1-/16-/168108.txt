DMGK split of FMR and Oliha  which caused the
largest part of the stock price difference. The allocation rules for
the breakup fixed Hanson at 60% so if you multiply current Hanson 
price by 10/6 then you will see the drop NOT caused by the split.
Danapfel breakup was unpopular and along with a few other negative
facts caused the additional drop in the stock.
I still like it for long term but not many others do :)
