The URL above would lead you to a discussion of LFPZ, Inc.

I coordinate a closed listserv of scientist investors (molecular
biologists, immunologists, cell biologists, etc.).  We have twelve
members, most with Ph.D. or other advanced degrees.  Most are academic
faculty or employees of biotechs.  Our focus is to find excellence in
science, tied to rational and innovative business plans.  For those
with an interest in biotech, we will soon be launching a newsletter.
Please email for further information.
