ANNOUNCEMENT 
We are aiming at collecting 10 % of the voting power based on mandates
to be used at WVEH shareholders meetings if
required and to further negotiate about a redemption of shares with the
strategic shareholders. 

The suggested redemption price is FIM 50 (currently trading  FIM 18-19)
per share unless a  lower price is required to be set by the
shareholders giving mandates. 

We are asking for shareholders mandates concerning the sale of shares.

A secondary mandate is to be given concerning a special revision of
accounts which is to be organized should the potential buyers refuse to
further negotiate about the meant redemption. 

This project is based on interests primarily to arrange a decent
compensation for minor shareholders and secondarily to survey  the
actions of the management should they not be responsive to the
shareholders requirements.

As the publisher wants the opinion of the large public concerning
specially the ETHICAL points of these
kind of activities we are asking for Your comments. Please, visit our
web home pages 
<Qmmn://qwgumhfb.zcikh.bb/yw/utbtc/potsc.odpn> 
and send any response / inquiries to previously named mailinglist.

Yours very  truly,
AIS OY (Ltd)
Mr. Oana Neb
