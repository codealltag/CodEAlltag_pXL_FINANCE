MICRO-CAP NEWS

FREE subsciption now available via e-mail - - no strings attached! 

You might have heard of micro-cap stocks - they are the smallest of
small cap stocks; 'small' is not necessarily defined by price but by
capitalization.  Some investors love them, others hate them.  A lot 
of micro-cap stocks have a 'great story' but often thats about all 
they have, however 'volatile by nature' they may be they also offer
the aggressive and PROPERLY INFORMED investor a chance to 
experience extraordinary gains.  These stocks trade for a few cents
to a few dollars a share.  Our reasearch is concentrated on stocks
that trade on the following exchanges:

Matzack Small PFCB
OTC Bulletin Board
The Oberp√∂ring Stock Idee
The Moosdorf Stock Idee
Canadian Unlisted (OTC) Exchange (COATS)

MICRO-CAP NEWS recommendations are screened and researched
from thousands of listings on these exchanges.  Our readers are
continually updated on the progress of our stock choices.  We
also pass on to you selected market commentary on micro-cap 
markets from the financial press and news services.  Unlike a lot of
other market letters we follow the MICRO-CAP NEWS will also let
our subscribers know WHEN WE FEEL THE TIME IS RIGHT TO
TAKE PROFITS in the stocks we follow.

MICRO-CAP NEWS does not issue a new buy recommendation 
every day or every week - some letter do - we don't feel it is
possible to properly research that many stocks.  Don't forget some
of the market letter writers out there are PAID BY THE COMPANIES
they recommend to their readers!  NO ONE AT MICRO-CAP NEWS
IS PAID CASH OR STOCK OR ANYTHING ELSE TO WRITE UP
A "BUY RECOMMENDATION", carry on reasearch or report on any
company we follow.  We would rather issue fewer stock reviews
and be confident of the outcome, therefore we only issue four to
six "buy recommendations" per year - - - MAXIMUM.

You don't need more than that to make excellent returns.  Another
thing to watch out for is letters that tell you to trade in and out of
these small stocks over a few days or weeks.  As a rule the only
one that makes money when you try to do short term trades is your
stock broker.  You have to buy into these small companies early or
before the 'action' starts and you need reliable and accurately
researched information - that's what MICRO-CAP NEWS will give
you.

A lot of these micro-cap companies have 'fantastic sounding stories'
or 'properties' and no doubt a few will go on to bigger and better
stock exchanges to become very successful corporations.  It 
doesn't matter because history has proved MOST OF THEM 
WON'T!  Most will have a brief life in the limelight and thats it!  The
trick is NOT to 'fall in love' with these stocks and hold them for
years in the remote hopes they might become one of the very
few that become successful.  The idea is  to get in early - BEFORE 
all the hype starts and stay for a 'short ride up and out'.

We search for micro-cap stocks that have NOT YET been 
DISCOVERED - HYPED or PROMOTED and therefore have YET
TO HAVE THEIR BIG RUN-UP.  There are thousands of stocks
like this out there.The MICRO-CAP NEWS "buy recommendations"
are timed so that our readers have a chance to get in a  stock
before the crowd jumps in - - hold it for a few months and then get
out.  We would NEVER suggest you sink your life savings into
these type of stocks - - just spend what you can afford without
taking 'bread' from the table.  When you see a stock you like in
MICRO-CAP NEWS limit your purchase to a MAXIMUM of two
or three thousand dollars - no more.  We look for situations we
feel will give our subscribers a 40 - 50% return on their investment,
in some cases it will be much higher.

Following are just a FEW examples out of thousands of micro-cap
stocks (from the exchanges we follow) that have had increases
far exceeding our goal of 40 - 50% gains.  These stocks all had
their major runs within a few months to a maximum of twelve. 

SOUTH DUVL (SDG) - went from 4 cents to $2.96 per share
ECCS INC (ECCS) - from $1.50 to $4.12
ALPINE (AXC) - from 7 cents to $1.01
PACIFIC AXI RS (PXV) - from 33 cents to $2.96
MISONIX (MSON) - from 68 cents to $8.60
ALTAIR INT GOLD (AUG) - from $1.23 to $7.33
NEWQUEST (NQEA) - from $1.48 to $4.00
CAPCO RES (CPD) - from 44 cents to $10.36
VYREX (VYRX) - from $2.22 to $15.91

STAMFORD (STFD) - from 9 cents to $1.81
CALIAS (CIS) - from $2.22 to $15.91

All prices are in U.S. dollars.

The list goes on and on, these examples show the twelve month high
and low for these stocks.  It would of course be impossible for MICRO
CAP NEWS to pick every stock at its low and sell at its highest point
and we are not suggesting we can.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist
to figure out you don't have to buy in at the ABSOLUTE BOTTOM and
sell out at the ABSOLUTE TOP to make money on these stocks.
Again our goal is to make our subscribers 40 - 50% on their money
over a few months on each stock. The stocks listed above are NOT 
our past or current picks - - these stocks are shown simply to 
illustrate to you the spectacular profits possible in micro-cap stocks,
and all of the increases shown took place in less than a year.
These are the type of situations we are constantly SEARCHING TO
UNCOVER FOR OUR SUBSCRIBERS.  They also show you the
huge potential out there as long as you have the RIGHT 
INFORMATION AT THE RIGHT TIME.

Don't let the next so-called 'hot stock' pass you by - - MICRO-CAP
NEWS will show you the stocks to buy in early - - while it's still a
'sleeper' - before the 'street' discovers it - OR BEFORE THE STOCK
IS PROMOTED to the crowd.  And remember if your broker is telling
you to buy a small cap stock you can be 99% sure its TOO LATE
BY THE TIME HE HEARS ABOUT IT - - forget it!  It won't cost you
a cent to subscribe just type in 'SUBSCRIBE' in the body of your
e-mail.  NO name, NO phone numbers or snail mail addresses
required.  No one will EVER contact you to try to sell you anything
and your e-mail address will NEVER be sold, rented or given out for
any reason - GUARANTEED.
