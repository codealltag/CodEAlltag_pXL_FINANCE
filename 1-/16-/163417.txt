    Re:IRU/VSE, METRO 
    Trading at $2.10 on 54,000 shares Wed., news release 17. 11. 21


    While lots of companies have prospects, METRO has
    excellent gold and silver values already.

    They have 3 properties with $7 million already spent in exploration, 
    and $5.9 million in the bank to acquire and explore more.

    Their 50/50 partner Viceroy produced 180,000 ounces of gold in 1995.
    If they like Rose there must be a really good reason.

    They also have one of Argentina's top geologists on board who
has       good property connections and now they can acquire other
properties     100% on their own as long as it isn't too close to
existing     properties.
    Plus they have or are soon going to apply for a TSE listing.

    Seems like a good situation for short or long term.
