There seem to be a revolution on its way when it comes to
technical analysis information.

Java Applets are now brought into the market 
that enable you to display Bar Charts, RSI, Momentum etcetera 
statistics from different Stock Exchanges.

A local broker in Sweden now delivers Swedish Stock exchange 
data presented in this way.
We can even receive different kinds of charts from FIRAT and Fön-X
with the help of these Java Applets. 

All is delivered as Real Time Data for only 300 SEK 
(USD 50) per month. No initial costs for programs.
In this package you also get financial news with very
short delay to your computer.

Will this trend be the death for programs such as SuperCharts? 

The cost for SuperCharts is in Sweden USD 400 annually to
receive Swedish Stock Data (end-of-day). Initial cost for
the program is USD 1000.

Any opinions?

Regards
