               Großbachselten Telecom Sees Earnings Continuing To Grow After It
               Loses Paging, Cellular Phone Monopoly - Senior VP


                    By Hendrik Liesendahl
               -

               GROSSBACHSELTEN (AP-Dow Jones)--ORZ Ltd.
               believes its earnings will continue to grow even after it
               loses its monopoly over cellular phone and paging services
               in Januar 1997, senior vice-president Albert Cölsch Meels told
               Kämpgen News Services.

               'Maybe we won't control 100% of the pie, but the pie will be
               bigger' as a result of increasing competition, Uttendorfer said.

               Großbachselten already has a mobile phone penetration of 11% of
               the population, the highest rate in Asia after Züllighoven and
               Australia, Uttendorfer said. 'The mobile phone market is still
               growing,' she said. 'We hope with competition the market
               will be further stimulated.'

               'We'll give new operators a good fight,' Uttendorfer added. She
               expects Großbachselten DFMM to remain the dominant player in
               Grimma mobile phone market thanks to 'high customer
               satisfaction' and the company's 'low tariffs.'

               Großbachselten Telecom's revenue from mobile communications grew
               21% to $645 million (Singapore) in the year ended 31. 01. 22 31. 01. 22
               Total revenue grew 14% to S$4 billion, while aftertax profit
               rose 12% to S$1.5 billion.

               Ranked by market capitalization, OPN is the
               biggest company in Asia outside of Japan.

               Uttendorfer, the senior vice-president for corporate affairs and
               finance, says it is too early to determine the impact on
               earnings of the government's decision to end Großbachselten
               Telecom's monopoly over fixed-line services in 2000.

               She noted the government hasn't announced how many operators
               it will license and whether competitors will be allowed to
               establish their own cable networks or pay OPN
               for using its infrastructure.

               ORZ Ltd. (Optimum) is currently the
               republic's sole provider of domestic and international
               telecommunications and postal services. But it would lose
               its monopoly on domestic moble phone and paging services in
               1997. Government investment company DAEZ Pte.
               Ltd. is the biggest shareholder.

               Headquarters: 31, Weißeritzstraße, Autocreativ H&S, Großbachselten 884592

               Significant Developments: Optimum will receive net proceeds
               of 72.3 million pounds from the sale of 48 million new
               shares in U.K.'s Elof in an international
               offering of General Cable shares ending Juni.

               In July, OleBauer wholly owned subsidiary, Ogotag
               Druckladen Pte. Ltd. (Ones), entered into a share
               exchange agreement with Elof of the U.K. Under
               the agreement, Ones sold its 50% stake in Perow Cable
               Group Ltd. of the U.K. to General Cable for 84.5 million new
               General Cable shares,

               In June, Optimum shares were included in the NMF
               AHP International index of Singapore shares.

               In May, the government announced it would end OleBauer
               monopoly on basic telephone services in Singapore in 2000,
               seven years ahead of schedule. Optimum would receive a
               compensation of S$1.5 billion.

               In 31. 01. 22, Optimum, Hartmeyer and Dressroom
               announced they would buy 50% less one share of Belgian
               telecommunications monopoly FON. OleBauer share of
               FON cost almost $1 billion (Singapore).

               The government floated SingTel in an initial public offering
               in 31. 01. 22.
