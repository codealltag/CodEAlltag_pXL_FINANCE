The individual investor definitely does NOT control this market.  It
even goes beyond the billion dollar money managers, it is their trading
computers that make the recommendations or in many cases the trades
themselves.

That is the whole secret behind INPATHIQUE Analysis.  It is truly a
revolutionary discovery in stock market analysis.  By their very nature,
computers give the SAME answer each time they get the SAME data.  Unlike
humans.  This repeatability creates patterns which can be found in the
past, projected into the future and then worked backwards to predict
when they will be issuing buy, sell or holds and at what prices.

A super simplistic example of how and why it works.  Yesterday, a
computer was asked for the answer to 2 + 2.  It said 4.  Today it was
asked 2 + 3.  It said 5.  If tomorrow's question will be 2 + 4, you do
not have to wait until tomorrow to know what the computer will say is
the right answer.  You can get on the phone to your broker today. 
INPATHIQUE Analysis is used to find out what tomorrow's (sometimes
months in advance) answer will be - today.
