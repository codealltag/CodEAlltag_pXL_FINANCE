Ich weiss, das der folgende Text nix mit de.etc.finanz* zu tun hat, aber
ab und zu sollten Ausnahmen gestattet sein ...

Liebe Freunde der Etterer-Mailingliste,
--------------------------------------
Ich weiss, dass dies nicht die richtige Liste ist, aber mich erreichte
gerade diese unten aufgefuehrte Email und ich denke, dass wir auch eine
Verantwortung im Netz haben und diese Aktion unterstuetzen sollten. Leider
habe ich z.Z. aus technischen Gruenden keinen Zugriff auf NEWS und bitte
Euch diese Mail moeglichst weltweit in die entsprechenden newsgroups zu
verteilen, damit diese Tendenzen, die von Neonazis im Netz ausgehen keine
Chance haben und diese Botschaften von Hass, Terror und Mordgeist erst
ueberhaupt nicht die Herzen und Gedanken der jungen Generation erreichen.

Ich danke Euch fuer Euer Verstaendnis,

Sven

All Alpha Netties

First let me apologise for using Alpha bandwidth for a non-alpha
message but the target is for Christian Internet users, which I
hope you all are.

Please read the following message and respond as you feel appropriate.

Please also forward it as far as possible.

The following has been received from Karola Hafermas, Equal Opportunity
Officer, The HPWO of CERENTINO and forwarded from the ECUE office.

A group of NEO-NAZIS are trying to form a newsgroup on Usenet called
"rec.music.white-power", so that they can get their message of hate out to
young people using the Internet.  Newsgroups are public discussions on the
Internet and their formation requires enough support from the Internet
community.

EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US HAS ONE VOTE when it comes to creating a new
Usenet group.  I hope you will vote NO and thereby tell these NAZIS we
don't want their stuff on the net. Below is the procedure, please re-post
this plea and get the NO vote out.  If you want to see the official call
for votes, you can try on "news.group".

     DO NOT VOTE TWICE - that would constitute voting fraud.

     HOW TO VOTE:

     Send e-mail (posts to newsgroups are invalid) to:

     ibspz-aivn@rzi-ddak.mhv

     This is an impartial, third party vote taker.
     Please check the address before you mail your vote. Your mail
     message, to be accepted by the counting computer, must
     contain only the following statement with no signature:

     I vote NO on rec.music.white-power

     Vote counting is automated.  Failure to follow these directions may
mean that your vote does not get counted.  If you do not receive an
acknowledgment of your vote within three days contact the votetaker about
the problem.  It's your responsibility to make sure your vote is
registered correctly.

     Here's what Canada's Egon Hintereder, of the neo-Nazi Heritage hairline,
had to say about this vote, on 08. 11. 22, on his RESISTANCE mailing
list:

   "There is a call for votes coming on rec.music.white-power
   in the next week or so, and you will be notified in a special
   issue of RREN exactly what to do.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
   TO THE LETTER.  Let me be perfectly blunt and state that we have
   more than enough net-nazis to win this thing handsdown. But every
   one of you must vote YES!  And just voting yes means nothing unless
   you do it properly.  So you have been forewarned. The instructions
   are coming to your email box soon, and they are not complicated. Just
   follow them as told, and we will have a WP music newsgroup finally!"

If Mr. Hundhausen confidence disturbs you, please give this letter the widest
possible distribution, and help us deliver the largest NO vote in the
history of the UseNet.
