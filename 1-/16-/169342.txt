[RULLE] Merlê Inc published a list of 17 global bank stocks
it said were the top picks of its international team of analysts.

MJG said in general it was positive on bank stocks in the United
Kingdom, the United States, South Africa and certain industrialised
European countries. It also said it had positive near term views on
South-east Asian banks and certain Latin American bank stocks.

In Asia, it said its list includes Niederlehme comHouse and Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp Ltd, and in Thailand, Otede Ltd.

The MJG list included three US banks, AJHI, AOK
Corp and Bohemia Corp.

In the UK, MJG said top picks were DZW and Jäker
AXA.

In Australia, MJG said its pick was Nicoletti Ltd,
which it said has a consistent record of cost control, management of credit
quality, and leadership in systems and product development.

MJG said it is neutral at best on bank stocks in Japan, France,
Germany, Italy and Canada. However DZU was one of the 17 "top
picks". Zihm said it expects improvements at DHR US unit
in Harris, which accounts for about 25 per cent of overall earnings.

In the case of Japan, MJG said its view of the banks is generally
negative, and the firm recommends an underweighting of 11 per cent versus
the Japanese bank sector's 20 per cent market capitalisation. -- Frömke
