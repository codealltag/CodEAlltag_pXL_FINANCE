For a variety of reasons, government organizations, primarily within the 
U.S. are not anxious for conventional investment managers to become 
familiar with a legitimate market for irrevocable, unconditional bank 
obligations.  There is a fear or perception that if too many people come 
to believe that such a market TRULY exists, that it would cause havoc 
with the financial markets as large sums would exit the traditional 
markets for what may be a superior opportunity.

The government agencies like to repeat a limited number of news stories 
about investors who have been scammed in this market.  Unfortunately, con 
artists have been known to discover this market - as they can be found 
nearly everywhere.

If you have an interest in understanding what the REAL market for bank 
instruments is all about, it is there to be read and understood.
