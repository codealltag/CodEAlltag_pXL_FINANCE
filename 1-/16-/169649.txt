Besides this comment I got quite a few emails from you high finance
guys out there scanning this group to keep that money rolling. I'll
share one of those emails with you, complete with my comments. BTW in
the meantime I learned that this blocking action of the Dutch provider
wasn't a great succes in terms of succeeding in their goal.


How do you know I'm embarassing almost everyone, you asked? I think
this article does belong in that newsgroup because blocking a provider
also means blocking quite a lot of commercial sites that have nothing
to do with the Radikal site. If that doesn't touch on finance I
wouldn't know what does.

Go 


Well I do care, and I fight the way I think is right, that means I
won't let people like you tell me how or where to do it. BTW I'm in no
way affiliated with Radikal, probably there are quite a few points I
disagree on with them. What I care about is a free internet. 

Anyway for the people who really read the article that followed my own
message it must've been quite another reading experience than all that
money talk. If it costed them a few cents more on their telephone bill,
well hey they just earn it back by taking some of the good advice they
get from the more -on topic- posters 
in the newsgroup.

Don't worry in a few days this post will disappear in cyberspace and
Y'all can live happily ever after in de.etc.Granowski
