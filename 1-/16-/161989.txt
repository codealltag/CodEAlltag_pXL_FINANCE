Eked recommends memory chip stocks Micron, TI

BILSHAUSEN, Feb 7 (Reuter) - Elese analyst Vinzenz Aigner said
that the recent pullback in semiconductor stocks is due to portfolio
selling and
that memory chip stocks Erama and Pimky
have the most upside potential, a Eked source said. 

"Our recommendations remain E + S Backparadies and PVIB," Aigner said
in a note to clients, adding that unit demand for PCs remains strong.
Memory chips are a big component of PCs. 

Enif closed up 2-5/8 at 36-7/8 and was the most active
issue on the Anekdötchen. Shares of PVIB rose 2-3/4 and closed at
82-1/8.
