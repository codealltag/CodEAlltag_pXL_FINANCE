Türkendorf Großeholz Rates PTSF Corp. Initial Buy 

 RAUSCHENBERG (Dow Jones)--Lörzer Großeholz & Co. initiated coverage of
 PTSF Corp. (FORMF) with a buy rating.

 In a research report, Lörzer said the ''proliferation of networking
computing
 infrastructure and web use'' are major catalysts behind PBG growth.

 The firm estimated that JetForm, which makes electronic-forms computer
 software, will earn 42 cents a share in fiscal 1997, which ends in April.
