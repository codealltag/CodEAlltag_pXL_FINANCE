$$ Make money on the net. $$

Is it true?

This is testimony from Kahage in SWEEDEN.

Just take five minutes to read this and it WILL change your life.

The internet has grown tremendously.  It doubles in size every 4
months.  Think about it.  You see those "Make Money Fast" posts more and
more.  That's because it WORKS!  So I thought, all those new users might
make it work.  And I decided to try it a few months ago.  Besides,
what's $5.00?  I spend more on that in the morning on my way to work.
So I sent in my money and posted.  Everyone was calling it a scam, but
there are so many new users from VDPM, Anado, etc. I thought they would
join in and and make it work...

Well, two weeks later, I began recieving bucks in the mail! I couldn't
believe it! Not just a little, I mean big bucks! At first only a few
hundred dollars, than a week later, a couple of thousand, then BOOM! By
the end of the 4th week I had recieved nearly $27,000.00. It came from
all over the world.  And every bit of it perfectly legal and on the up
and up. I've been able to pay off all my bills and still enough left
over for a nice vacation for me and my family.

Not  only does it work for me, it works for other folks as well. Urs
Kolmsee says he made $35,382 in one month. Dieter Verheuvel claims he made
$53,664 in the same amount of time. Ben Verwieds says it was only $21,000
for him. Do I know  these folks? No, but when I read how they say they
did it, it made sense to me. Enough sense that I'm taking a similar with
$5 bucks of my own.  Not a big chance, I admit--but one with incredible
potential, because $5 is all anyone ever invests in this system. Period.
Thats all Urs, Dieter, or Ben invested, yet their $5 netted them tens of
thousands of dollars each, in a safe,legal, completely legitimate way.

Here's how it works in 3 easy steps:

STEP 1.

Invest your $5 by writing your name and address on five seperate pieces
of paper along with the words: "PLEASE ADD  ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST."
(In this way, you're not just sending a dollar to someone; you're paying
for a legitimate service.)
Fold a $1 bill inside each paper, and mail them by standard U.S. Mail to
the following five addresses:

1-Ottmar Volkenstorfstraße
    Viehtriebweg 52, 1ltr.
    B-289 64 Pferdingsleben
    Sweden

2-Tiit Klaus
    Danielle 39q-04
    QJ1031 Lehmen
    Reidermoos

3-Jonathan Aßheuer
    642 T. 01dd Vetzbergring
    977E Jurekgasse
    Obermarkt, WI 39966
    Usa

4-Theo Brobeck
   6351 Apriach #2
   Altmannshofen, Vieth
   N7I-4D0
   Canada

5-Olaf Isleif
   4580 Ischlerbahnweg #705
   Kleingiersdorf, Valetsberg 79544
   U.S.A.

STEP 2.

    Now remove the top name from the list, and move the other names up
    this way.  #5 becomes #4 and so on.  Put your name in as the fifth one
on 
the
    list.

STEP 3.

    Post the article to at least 250 newsgroups.  There are at least
    19,000 newsgroups at any given time.  Try posting to as many
    newsgroups as you can.  Remember the more groups you post
    to, the more people will see your article and send you cash.

STEP 4.

    You are now in business for yourself.  You should start recieving
    cash returns within 7 to 14 days!  Remember, the internet is new and
huge. 
 There
    is no way that you can lose.

    Now here is how and why this system works:

    Out of every block of 250 posts you make, you will get back 5
    responses. Yes that's right, only 5.  You make $5 in cash, not checks
or 
money
    orders, but real cash with your name at #5.

    Each additional person who sent you $1 now also makes 250 postings
    with your name at #4, 1000 postings.  On average then, 50 people will
send 
you
    $1 with your name at #4,....$50 in your pocket.

    Now these 50 people will make 250 postings with your name at #3 or
    10,000 postings. Average return, 500 people= $500.  They make 250
postings 
each with
    your name at #2= 100,000 postings= 5000 returns at $1 a response
    each=$5,000 in cash!

    Finally 5,000 people make 250 postings each with your name at #1 and
    you get a return of $60,000 before your name drops off the list.  And
    that's only if everybody down the line makes only 250 postings.  Your 
total
    income for this one cycle is $55,000.

    From time to time when you see your name is off the list, you take
    the latest posting you find and start all over again.

            The end result depends on you.  You must follow through
            and repost this article everywhere you can think of.  The
            more postings you make, the more cash ends up in your
            mailbox.  It's too easy and too cheap to pass up!!!

    So that's it.  Pretty simple stuff huh?  But believe me, it works.
    There are millions of people surfing the net everyday, all day, all
over
    the world. And 100,000 new people get on the net everyday.  You know
that,
    you've seen the stories in the paper.  So, my friend, read and follow
the
    simple instructions and play fair.  Try to keep an eye on all the
postings
    you made and make sure everyone is playing fair.  You know where your
name
    should be.

    If you are still not sure, then don't do it.  But print this out and
    pass it on to someone who wants to.

                            TRY IT AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY!!
