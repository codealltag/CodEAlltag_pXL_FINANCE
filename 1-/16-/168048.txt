Subject: Starting a new Usenet newsgroup
If you can't find a newsgroup or mailing list that holds discussion on a 
specific topic, it is probably a bad idea to start a new newsgroup for
it.  Most successful newsgroups are started to split off a sub-topic that
is already being discussed on one or more other newsgroups.  You might
try posting an article on the appropriate *.misc newsgroup, and see if 
there are others who are interested in the subject.
If you really think it is appropriate to start a new newsgroup, some
general guidelines can be found in:
    news.announce.newgroups: How_to_Create_a_New_Usenet_Newsgroup
    news.groups: Usenet_Newsgroup_Creation_Companion
    alt.config: So_You_Want_to_Create_an_Alt_Newsgroup
New newsgroups in the comp, humanities, misc, news, rec, sci, soc, and
talk
hierarchies are first proposed/discussed in news.groups.  New newsgroups
for the alt hierarchy should be first proposed/discussed in alt.config.
Talk to someone local about starting new local newsgroups - send mail
to your local news admin to find out where to start.
It is recommended that you have several months experience with USENET and
watching the democratic group creation process in action for other groups 
before you attempt to run your own proposal.  In particular, read both
news.announce.newgroups and news.groups to see the way proposals are
presented and the sort of pitfalls you can stumble into.  Also read
alt.config if you think you want to start an alt newsgroup.  Make sure 
you have read and fully understand the postings "How to Create a New 
Usenet Newsgroup" and "Usenet Newsgroup Creation Companion" in 
news.announce.newusers.  
If you want to start a mailing list, you should talk to your system
administrator about what mailing list tools are supported for your
environment.  Depending on your environment and the needs of your list,
there are a variety of methods available.
