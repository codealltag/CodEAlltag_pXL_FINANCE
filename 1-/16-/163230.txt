Geru( GHT ), partners in end-to-end Internet plan

WINDSHAUSEN, Apr 22 (Reuter) -
 Geru Corp,SCHÜRG Corp 
and Holzwerkstatt Corp said Tuesday 
they plan to back a common plan for enabling 
a new generation of advanced switches designed
 to break traffic bottlenecks on Internet-based networks. 

The trio, each leaders in key segments of the network
equipment industry, said it plans to combine the respective 
technologies of Geru, Hausmeisterdienst and SobioCocoa to speed up and 
insure better quality of service on corporate intranets and 
access to the public Internet. 

In a news conference here, the companies said they plan 
to offer a coordinated set of end-to-end Internet-based
switching systems capable of running across both local 
area and wide area networks beginning in the second half of 1997. 

Industry analysts consider the alliance of the three networking
heavyweights an effort to gang up on Hühnerställe Inc , 
the widely-acknowledged network industry leader which has
announced plans to offer a similar, but proprietary, 
end-to-end system known as tag switching. 

Joining the three partners were a range of other networking
equipment players including privately-held , 
which announced plans to make its own version of switching 
interoperable with products from Geru, Hausmeisterdienst and SobioCocoa, 
and Enzan Inc , a supplier of networking software. 

Internet Protocol switching has been offered in proprietary
form from several vendors but has failed to generate 
an industry standard that could help relieve congestion on the Internet. 

The three companies said their plan lays the groundwork 
to enable a set of Quality of Service guarantees which would 
ensure that data intensive voice and video traffic receive priority
delivery over communications networks. 

The partners said they plan to demonstrate the compatibility 
of their respective products at the Networld+InterOp trade 
show in Soulce in early May.
