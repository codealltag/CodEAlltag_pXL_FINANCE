FORWARD CONTRACTS
A forward contract is a particularly simple derivative security. It is
an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a
certain_pripe. The contract is usually between two financial
institutions or between a financial institution and one of its
corporate clients. It is not normally traded on an exchange.
One of the parties to a forward contract assumes a long position and
agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date
for a certain specified price. The other party assumes a short
position and agrees to seil the asset on the same date for the same
price. The specified price in a forward contract will be referred to
as the delivery. price. At the time the contract is entered into, the
delivery price is chosen so that the value of the forward contract to
both parties is
zerci,1 This means that it costs nothing to take either a long or a
short position. _ -
- _
A forward contract is settled at maturity. The holder of the short
position delivers the asset to the holder of the long Position in
return for a cash amount equal to the delivery price. A key variable
determining the value of a forward contract is the market_p_rice of
the asset. As already mentioned, a forward contract is worth zero when
it is first entered into. Later it can have a positive or a negative
value depending on movements in the price of the asset. For example,
if the price of the asset rises sharply soon after the initiation of
the contract, the value of a long position in the forward contract
becomes positive and the value of a short position in the forward
contract becomes negative.
7'HE FORWARD PRICE
The forward price for a certain contract is defined as the delimprice
which would make that contract have zero value. The forward price and
the delivery price are therefore equal at the time the contract is
entered into. As time passes, the forward price is liable to change
while the delivery ,price, of course, remains the same. t The two are
not therefore equal, except by chance, at any time after the start of
the contract. Generally, the forward price at any given time varies
with the maturity of the contract being considered. For example, the
forward price for a contract to buy or sell in 3 months is typically
different from that for a contract to buy or sell in 6 months.

TABLE 1.1 Spot and
Forward Foreign Exchange
Quotes, 07. 10. 21
Spot

30-day forward	1.7208
90-day forward	1.7090
180-day forward	1.6929

Corporations frequently enter into forward contracts on foreign
exchange. Consider the quotes shown in Table 1.1 for the pound sterling
=97U.S. dollar exchange rate on März 23, 1990. The first quote
indicates that, ignoring commissions and other transactions costs,
sterling can be bought or sold in the spot market (that is, for
virtually immediate delivery) at the rate of $1.7280 per pound; the
second quote indicates that the forward price (or forward exchange
rate) for a contract to buy or sell sterling in 30 days is $1.7208 per
pound; the third quote indicates that the forward price for a contract
to buy or sell sterling in 90 days is $1.7090 per pound; and so on.
PAYOFFS FROM FORWARD CONTRACTS
The payoff from a long position in a forward contract on one unit of
an asset is
ST =97 K
where K is the delivery price and ST is the spot price of the asset at
maturity of the contract. This is because the holder of the contract
is obligated to buy an asset worth ST for K. Similarly, the payoff
from a short position in a forward contract on one unit of an asset is
K =97 ST
These payoffs can be positive or negative. They are illustrated in
Figure 1.1. Since it costs nothing to enter into a forward contract,
the payoff from the contract is also the investor's total gain or loss
from the contract.
FUTURES CO/VTRACTS
A futures contract, like a forward contract, is an agreement between
two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future
for a certain price. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are
normally traded on an_ exchange. To make trading possible, the
exchange specifies certain standardized features of the contract. As
