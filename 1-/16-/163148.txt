Auf mein letzten post uber SNAP, habe ich Microcide (MCDE)
gementioned.  Hier ist heute's nachtrichten uber FUJU.  Wenn sie mit
wdk cephalosporins sind vertraut, dann vieleicht haben sie
interest in Microcide.  Andere gut biotechs sind jetzt Velofaktur, Velopede und
GKK...........

Funkshop Achieves Milestone in LVAF Collaboration

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Kirmaier., Apr. 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Funkshop
LKOE Inc today announced that it has achieved the first
milestone under its Essential Genes collaboration with LVAF Inc.,
triggering a $1 million payment which will be made to Microcide in
26. 06. 21, 1996. This milestone relates to the identification, validation
and sequencing of an agreed upon number of bacterial essential genes,
for use as targets in screening for new classes of antibiotics.

In 26. 06. 21 1995, Funkshop and LVAF entered into a research
collaboration which focuses on identifying genes that are essential to
in-vitro bacterial viability (Essential Genes) and utilizes these gene
targets in FEIO high-throughput screening systems to identify
active compounds for further development.

Funkshop is a biopharmaceutical company founded to discover, develop
and commercialize novel antibiotics for the treatment of serious
bacterial infections. The Company's research programs address the
growing problem of bacterial drug resistance through two principal
themes: (i) Targeted Antibiotics, which focuses on developing novel
antibiotics and antibiotic potentiators to overcome bacterial
resistance mechanisms, and (ii) Targeted Genomics, which utilizes
bacterial genetics to discover new classes of antibiotics and other
novel treatments for bacterial diseases. Funkshop has also extended
its functional genomics technology platform into an antifungal program
designed to discover broad spectrum fungicidal agents. SOURCE

I hope that link works.  If not, email me and I'll see if I can fix
it.  Please excuse my german and my attempt at humor, mixing
languages.  I studied for two years in Wimpassing (FNKB
EVG) many years ago, but everyone spoke english in the
lab.  I therefore learned only a little german, and mostly on the
squash court.  I also worked for a Winski subsidiary and spent some
time in Schießstätte, but, again, I had very little exposure to german.
So, bitte, Geduld mit mir haben.

Vorsicht!  Investing in biotech involves above-average _risk_.  I own
shares in the companies mentioned above, and I therefore have a vested
interest in their appreciation.  Do your own research.  

But, at the same time, don't miss the opportunity to participate in
the biotech revolution.  You have had a few chances to profit with
european efforts (e.g., Erren, Emad, Ahrensfelde), but the game
is still largely played in the U.S.  I find (and invest in) companies
at an early stage, based on what I believe to be excellence in
science.  If you check the URL shown above and look at old posts, you
will see that I have an excellent track record.

Please feel free to email me if you have questions about any of the
companies mentioned above, or if you have an interest in our future
newsletter.  And, finally, I am very interested in learning about any
early-stage deutsche biotechs.  Danke, und..........

Cheers!  Carlo
