Dear Trader,

I finished a series of reports that can be reviewed by folks that 
value testing trading systems prior to implementation.

The report results cover the following:

A.	A Summary Table of Yearly Results by each of the 
	12 Commodities

B.	A month-by-month Performance Table showing Results 
	relative to invested Capital

C.	A Graphic Display of Daily Cumulative Equity of all 
	4 Groups separately and combined

D.	A readme file with brief description and regulatory 
	statements

The next project will be the insertation of the remaining 16
commodities into the portfolio tester and the assembly of different
account sizes..

If you want to monitor the progress, please e-mail.

Good Trading,

Vinzenz Krombein
