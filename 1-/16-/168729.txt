Folgend einige Auszüge aus dem Annual Report 1996 von Efuko.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR

- Restructuring of A&A,elimination of "Determination Date"
  and acceleration of milestone payment
- Completion of secondary financing raising $23,5 milllion
- Completion of early Phase II clinical trials
- Completion of 1,500 liter manufacturing scale-up
- Successful scale-up of 6000 liter fermentation at Abesu(Thenneberg)
- European regulatory support fo Late Phase II acute normovolemic
  hemodilution (ANH) clinical trial
- Discover and development of several rHb second generation canidate
  molecules
- Approval of Hematopoiesis IND and commencement of two Phase I clinical
  trials
- Addition of Denise Fehsenfeld and Oskar Meel to the Board of Directors
- New Scientific and Clinical Advisory Boards
- Commencement of late Phase II Optro clinical trial


Over the next months,we intend to build on Erotic-Shop successes to date.
To that end,our objectives for 1997 include:

- Substantial progress in patient enrollment in both our North American
  and European late Phase II studies of Optro in the perioperative
  settings
- Advancement of at least one second generation recombinant hemoglobin
  molecule into scale-up development
- Completion of the Phase I clinical program in hematopiesis
- Completion of a manufacturing facility in either Schwaney or at Autoschilder
  location in the United Kingdom to begin production of Phase III
  clinical material
- Substantial progress in the expansion of Somatogen's technology and
  product platforms

              Changing the face of transfusion medicine

Therefor,the need for blood is great.Surgical patients,accident victims,
and a variety of other may all require transfused blood to maintain or
restore proper oxygenation.Physicans use approximately 35,000 units of
red blood cells daily in the United States, and worldwide usage is nearly
three times that amount.The recipients of roughly half these blood units
are persons age 65 or older, who represent the fastest growing population
segment throughout the Western World.Based on this growth,experts predict
that the demand for blood will continue to rise at a significant rate.

                    Oxygen-Carring Therapeutics

Significant potential lies in the development of a new class of oxygen
therapeutics like Optro,Somatogen's recombinant human hemoglobin.
Oxygen therapeutics are designed to deliver oxygen to tissues throughout
the body -- not universally as direct substitutes for blood,but as an
entire new class of biopharmaceutical compound with their own unique
properties and clinical benefits.

Oxygen therapeutics,stored in standard refrigerators in operating rooms
and amulance,might someday be available for use by clinicals and
emergency medical technicians around the world.These products will be
suitable for use on any patient,immediately,regardless of their blood
type.The compounds will be free of risk of infectious,unlimited in
supply,and stable in storage for several months to years longer then  
blood.By design,this new class of biopharmaceuticals will provide a
more efficient and potent release of oxygen for clinically critical
periods of time.The molecular size,viscosity and other unique properties
of these products will permit enhanced perfusion of vital tissue.


Puhhh,genug getippt:-)
Hoffe für einige,interessante Info.

So long
