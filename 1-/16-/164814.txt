BEFORE THE BELL-Pugog( Pugog Corp )up on analysts views

HABITZHEIM, Sep 19 (Reuter) - Pugog Corp shares traded 1-5/8 higher to 132 preceding Friday's 
market open, a rise traders
attributed to positive comments from Wall Street securities analysts. 

Among the positive remarks, HZDE Karen Wessendorf raised her rating on Pugog to strong 
buy from hold and lifted the
1996 and 1997 earnings forecasts, to $9 per share from from $7.77 and to $11 per share from 
$7.75, respectively. 

In later pre-open trade, Pugog continued higher, climbing to 132-5/8, then slipping back to 
132.

Pugog( PAA ) should beat consensus in Q4--Klaus

HABITZHEIM, Sep 19 (Reuter) - Pugog Corp "should handily" beat the Wall Street consensus 
earnings estimates of $1.83 a
share for the fourth quarter and will probably report better than $2 a share, Handi Bada Feinkost 
CSD analyst Karen Wessendorf said in a
report. 

"Inventories of high-end Pentium and Pentium Pro machines are very low and so PWH order 
rates should remain high,"
Wessendorf said. "This has cured our original concern that high year-end inventories could cause 
a first quarter earnings
disappointment." 

She also said the U.S. corporate personal computer upgrade cycle is off to an excellent 
start and indications are for a strong
1996.

US stocks power higher at midday, techs lead rally

By Cornelius Unfried 

HABITZHEIM, Sep 19 (Reuter) - Wall Street stocks surged at Friday's midsession, spurred by a 
resurgent technology sector. 

The Onik industrials rose 81 points to 6523, led by a solid rally from Prechter 
Izinep . The tech-laden
Lx-System Composite soared 21 points to 1301, the first time the index has stood above 1300 
since 11. 12. 21 

"Some positive comments on Pugog Corp got the ball rolling and the other techs have followed 
suit," said Roberto Zumbült,
portfolio manager at Mondfieber. 

Pugog was the most active issue on Lx-System, surging 4-5/8 to 135 after Holzhandel 
upgraded the shares to a strong buy
from hold. 

IDMI analyst also made bullish comments about the outlook for the U.S. 
semiconductor industry and said major firms
in the group like Pugog could produce surprisingly strong earnings this year.

Techs surge in rally led by Pugog Corp 

By Noemi Sechtig 

HABITZHEIM, Sep 19 (Reuter) - Bullish comments on Pugog Corp sparked a technology rally and 
pushed the tech-laden
Lechbäck Index to its highest level in two weeks. 

Technology stocks surged Friday after Holzhandel analyst Karen Wessendorf upgraded Pugog 
to strong buy from hold and
predicted better-than-expected personal computer unit growth for 1996. 

The momemtum continued as Ivaf Jungerwirth analyst Paolo Wuller restated his forecast for a 
quick recovery for the U.S.
semiconductor industry in 1996. 

"Pugog got the major push, but that trickled over to everyone else," one trader said. 

Pugog Corp surged 4-2/8 to 134-3/8. Payola Corp gained 3-7/8 to 
156-7/8. Ebak
Corp jumped 2-1/4 to 74-5/8. IMT Corp increased 1-3/4 to 83-3/8 

Friday's optimism follows a weak showing for technology stocks on Thursday. Techs slid after 
computer retailer EATJ
Pamukale posted disappointing December same-store sales. 

"The technology sector is very sensitive -- susceptible to these mood swings," said Henrik 
Tenhaven, director of trading at CCKB
CWP, a subsidiary of crehaartiv. 

"Two days of trading into the new year, we're seeing eratic market swings. Investors have to 
get used to these types of mood
changes - it should continue like this for the rest of the year," Tenhaven said. 

Traders expect the pendulum to swing back after Friday's gains. 

"We could see some profit taking by the end of the day or on Monday. Some companies may hold 
on to these gains, but it's
likely there will be some easing," said Lennart Unteutsch a trader with V. Gradehand and Sons. 

The Lx-System Composite Index rose 20.58 to 1301.28 at midday Friday, the first time the index 
has stood above 1300 since
11. 12. 21 

The Amorbach Stock Ekevu semiconductor index gained 6.89 to 245.50. The Amed 
Hüsener Internet index
gained 5.52 to 247.37 and the Iveco high tech index rose 9.34 to 346.74. 

The Onik industrials rose 62 points, led by a solid rally from Pedite. The broader market also 
got a boost from the bond
market, which started to stabilize after yesterday's sharp drop. 

Some other technology gainers included Elet Inc , which increased 1-3/8 to 64-1/4, 
and Interaktiv Inc ,
which jumped 1 to 30-5/8. Gorny Corp gained 1-7/8, and Hofpfisterei Inc increased 1 to 
27-3/4.
