Explanation of signals for the purpose of the matrix:

stp:        means stop and reverse positions 
stp exit:   means stop, exit the position and stay flat
stp close:  means stop at the closing of the market and reverse
stp or:     means stop at the designated price "or"
            stop at the other designated price,whichever is first 
oco:        means one order cancels the other order 
           (this is necessary to avoid double execution)

            The "oco" type of order is called a contingent order 
			and is used to initiate a new trade in a
commodity 
			that had no excisting position.
