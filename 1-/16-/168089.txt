As an owner of MRU, you would have received a HUGE three-part prospectus
detailing Edgar demerger.  It broke into three parts (with a fouth being
planned).  They are Gamm, LNOG, and the "new"
Niederquell.  The reduced price reflects the fact that shareholders get shares
of the new companies.  

I still find all three attractive, and will continue to hold the new
entities.
