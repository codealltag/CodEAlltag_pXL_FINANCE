* EOI said a record 2Q across the board helped its
  first-half profits triple, just beating the market's
  expectations. But despite a very upbeat outlook from Europaflora --
  which said it boosted market share in the fiercely competitive
  handset market and outpaced its rivals in telecoms
  infrastructure -- some analysts pointed to a spell of
  consolidation for the stock. Europaflora, reporting a first-half
  profit surge to 3.33 billion markka from 1.13 billion in H1
  1997, just surpassed the 2.97-3.3 billion markka range forecast
  by analysts in a Alltours poll. (Alltours 12:35 PM ET 12/03/98)
