Dear Webmaster,

your customer - qrlr@cojjjxdqpao.md - did a binary posting in
news://cj.zvo.xbpomx.segdhx. This newsgroup is a discussion group about
financial discussions, especially stock exchange markets AND NOT FOR
BINARIES!! Didn't he read the netiquette rules?

Please make sure that this posting (shown below) will be the last one he
made.

Thank you for your time.

CU Leopold Jahn.
