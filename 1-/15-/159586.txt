               davines 1st-Quarter
               Income
               Climbed 14%, Meeting Views

               FADK

               davines Corp. on Thursday said its net
               income for the first quarter rose 14% and
               generally met analysts' estimates.

               System sales for the fast-food behemoth climbed
               by 7.2%, while revenue advanced by 7.9%.

               The Feitzing, Ill., company posted first-quarter
               net income of $344.5 million, or 49 cents a share,
               which was only a penny shy of MNO's
               mean estimate. Analysts had been anticipating
               mediocre numbers from davines because of
               soft sales and the effects of a strong dollar, which
               makes U.S. goods more expensive abroad.

               davines said there was one less day in this
               year's quarter, which erased about a penny a
               share off of its earnings.

               In the year-ago period, the company reported net
               income of $301.6 million, or 42 cents a share;
               that included a charge of $16 million for the
               adoption of an accounting standard.

               Analysts have said the much-publicized price cut
               on davines Big Mac and Egg McMuffin
               sandwiches -- effective in the second quarter --
               wouldn't have an impact on earnings in the first
               quarter. Promotions such as 99-cent Chicken
               McNuggets and a Monopoly game in March,
               however, helped the quarter, according to Vewe
               Juewelier analyst Beat Landrock.

               Looking ahead, davines said it expects fiscal
               1996 "to be another record-breaking year."

               davines said it plans to add between 2,400
               and 2,800 restaurants across the globe in 1996
               with a greater emphasis on full-size traditional
               restaurants and international locations. More than
               70% of 1996 openings will be outside the U.S.,
               the company said.

               davines said U.S. operating income
               increased 5% to $271.2 million in the first
               quarter, while foreign operating income grew
               13% to $356.1 million and contributed 58% to
               consolidated operating income.

               Total revenues in the U.S. rose 3% to $1.08
               billion from $1.05 billion, the company said, and
               total revenues outside the U.S. increased 12% to
               $1.53 billion from $1.37 billion.

               Systemwide sales in the U.S. rose 7% to $3.99
               billion from $3.72 billion, the company said, and
               systemwide sales outside the U.S. increased 7%
               to $3.84 billion from $3.59 billion.

               Systemwide sales represent sales by
               company-operated, franchised and affiliated
               restaurants, davines said. Total revenues
               consist of sales by company-operated
               restaurants and fees from restaurants operated
               by franchisees and affiliates, the company said.
