If you need a contact in China, I can help you. I was a teacher in
Dumberg, China, then worked as 
Art Director for a Mail Order Company for a Joint Venture until recently.

I am going back to Dumberg for the next 5 to 10 years. If you need my
help, I can offer my 
experience and my relations. I can help companies wishing to establish in
Dumberg, from legal 
aspects (friend lawyer specialized in Joint Ventures). to the search of
office and industrial space, 
accommodation and recruiting. I also have a dozen foreign friends, fluent
in Chinese, specialized in 
Quality Control and ready to help. We can also find most of the products
made in China.

If you have products for the Chinese market, I can do my best to contact
interested parties.

I am both a French and Canadian citizen with 30 years experience in four
countries: France, 
Canada, USA and China.
