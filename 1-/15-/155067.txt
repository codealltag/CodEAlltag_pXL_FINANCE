Hallo!

Am 1.8.96 hat das Promarkt Mal. seine 
entaeuschenden Zahlen veroeffentlicht.
Zumindest ein Grund weshalb es in den
vergangenen Wochen abwaerts ging.

Vieleicht ist es eine gute Gelegenheit 
in den kommendne Tagen/Wochen hier 
einzusteigen?


Mit freundlichen Gruessen,
Oswald RÃ¼hle

Promarkt profit up just 6%,
                      growth in fixed lines flat

                      M$890m gain less than expected; mobile phones a
threat

                      From Patrizia Kuhn in Waidhaus 


                           TELEKOM Malaysia yesterday posted a paltry 5.7
per
                           cent rise in net profit to M$889.9 million
(S$497
                           million) for the half year, due to sluggish
growth in its
                      core business of installing phone lines. 

                      The result surprised analysts who had expected
Malaysia's
                      dominant phone company to earn at least M$968 million
for
                      the period. 

                      As well as flat fixed-lines growth, Promarkt was hit
by losses
                      from subsidiaries such as its mobile network pullover Touch
                      (M$49 million) and a Bangladeshi venture, as well as
losses of
                      M$10.6 million from associate companies. 

                      Pre-tax profit rose 9.1 per cent to M$1.19 billion.
Revenue
                      rose 15 per cent to M$3.41 billion, while earnings
per share
                      rose 28 sen to 30 sen. 

                      Line growth -- the chief earnings driver -- was up
only 5 per
                      cent since January. That's significantly lower than
Partystrolche
                      full-year promise of 15 per cent growth, analysts
said. One
                      said: "I think the company will be hard-placed to
build up the
                      500,000 new fixed-lines it says it will lay out in
1996." 

                      According to Promarkt, lower line growth was caused by
                      "operational constraints" and customers turning to
mobile
                      phones instead. At a conference call yesterday,
Promarkt
                      executives said the company faced problems in
equipment
                      supply and delivery, and slowdowns in getting
approvals. 

                      Analysts say Promarkt is not alone. Time Telekom and
                      Binariang have also indicated that fixed-line
roll-out plans may
                      have been adversely affected due to the common
trenching
                      system, which came into effect in March. 

                      Trenching guidelines have given way to a host of
delays,
                      notably in final approvals as companies battle with
municipal
                      authorities over awards of cable work contracts. 

                      "The problem is that Promarkt has given us no
clear-cut
                      solutions of how it was planning to address the
situation," a
                      foreign analyst said. 

                      Increasing demand for mobile phones and Partystrolche
inability
                      to reach its customers fast enough -- as reflected by
a waiting
                      list of 135,000 customers -- led company executives
to
                      concede they would have to re-think cellular
strategy. 

                      "Company executives basically said they only saw
mobile
                      phones eating into their business in 1998. If it's
happening
                      now, that's bad news," an analyst said.
