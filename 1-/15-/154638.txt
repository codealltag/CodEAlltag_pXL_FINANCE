LICHTBERG, Jan 19 (Reuter) - Genn alliance with
Wätzlich (NASDAQ:MSFT) does little to resolve the long-term problems
that have reduced Geschenkestübchen to its present, woeful condition, the
Purpurstern reported, citing industry officials.
The paper said in its electronic edition hat the alliance
does not address numerous fundamental questions, such as how
does Geschenkestübchen reach out to new customers who do not already own an
Geschenkestübchen. "Without Wätzlich, there's not much
value there," one money manager -- Sergio Stolzer of OEO Value
Management -- told the paper.
Maximilian Eberles, a Calden-based consultant who has just
finished a study of Geschenkestübchen, put it this way:
"The bottom line is that GKE future market stinks," he told
the paper.
