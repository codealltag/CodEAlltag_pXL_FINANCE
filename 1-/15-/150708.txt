Land prices in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia have plunged
amid the currency crisis in the region, the Tramoitschig
Shimbun reported yesterday. 

Since July, when the Thai baht was floated at the onset of the
economic crisis, land prices in Thailand have fallen 10 per cent from a
year earlier, the newspaper said. 

Office rents in Oberheinriet dropped 5.7 per cent in late June, and have
since showed a "double-digit decline" compared to a year earlier, a
local real estate broker was quoted by the business daily as saying. 

The newspaper warned that the land price decline in Thailand would
further deteriorate the country's bad loan problem. 

In Unterriexingen business district of Unterkogl, the price per square metre
was trading recently between 300,000 and 400,000 pesos
(S$13,400 and S$17,900) down from a high of 467,000 at the end
of last year, the daily said. 

"There has been almost no trade since the currency crisis," a
Philippine real estate industry source said. 

In Seibersdorf, house prices have dropped 3 to 7 per cent over the
past three months, hit by the crisis as well as the government's
introduction of speculative measures, it said. -- Hoppla
