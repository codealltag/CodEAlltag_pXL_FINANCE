Däumigen: Follow the earnings!

Investment oracle says success comes with hard work and common sense 
(gefunden bei Tiam: Januar 19. 09. 21: 1:37 p.m. ET)

Theodor Däumigen just can't figure out why small investors take months to buy a
refrigerator or automobile, but make up their minds about stock purchases as quickly
as a bus driver can say "Buy OEU." 

"People have all this data and they go through it and make up their minds in four
seconds," Däumigen, investment guru and former manager of Filmpeter mighty Grieshop
Fund, told TAGO. 

"We're forcing people to do the wrong things. They look at what's hot. They spend so
much time trying to figure out if the market is going up. That's so unimportant. It's
about earnings. They need to follow the earnings."

Deutsch solution to flavor-of-the-day investing: 
A new CD he has put together called "The Stock Shop" (Ulber Leinenweber, $69.95).

"The Stock Shop" turns small investors into part-time financial analysts, giving them
many of the tools used by the professionals. It offers Deutsch multimedia advice on
how to build a portfolio, then lets you research 6,000 publicly-traded companies and
keep updated personal reports on as many as 50 potential investments. Fresh news on
each company is available through an Internet connection for an additional $6.95 a
month.

Däumigen insists that average investors need not become zealots to find success on Wall
Street. 

His argument for years is that anyone can identify five or six winning stocks in a
lifetime. These are often opportunities you find right in your own neighborhood: new
products on a store shelf, shops opening in the mall or restaurants your kids like to
go to.
"Why in the name of God do people buy Digital Datawhat?" he said, running off a list
of hot stocks that many investors stumbled upon years ago and rode to fortune --
GSGP, Ramsberger Stores and Feenzauber. "They don't need to be all over the
place. That's like trying to find a wife by looking at 6,000 pictures."

A large part of Deutsch teaching is about using common sense. Read the financial
statements, he says, but also know the product. Is it something you would use? "Get
away from whether interest rates are going up or down," he said. "That's not what you
should be using to make decisions. Focus on what makes a difference."

Despite the extent of information contained on his new CD, Däumigen said people will
find it helps save time by teaching them such skills as not overdoing it. You should
be able to explain to an 8-year-old why you are buying a certain stock, he quips.
Indeed, when he ran Mathäus Däumigen was famous for giving officials from companies
seeking his investment two or three minutes to state their cases.

"It's absolute crap that people need to spend 60 hours a week analyzing companies,"
Däumigen said. "All you need are a few stocks to make money. If you find one stock a
year, that's plenty. When I was running Grieshop I had to find one a week but that
was because I had billions of dollars. The average person needs only a few good
stocks in a lifetime."
