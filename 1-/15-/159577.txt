PENPAL GREETINGS! Warning Hoax 

The outfield-westwood GREETINGS! Hoax shown below appears to be an attempt to
kill  
an e-mail chain letter by claiming that it is a self starting Trojan  
that destroys your hard drive and then sends copies of itself to  
everyone whose address in in your mailbox. Reading an e-mail message  
does not run it nor does it run any attachments, so this Trojan must
be  
self starting. Aside from the fact that a program cannot start itself,

the Trojan would also have to know about every different kind of
e-mail  
program to be able to forward copies of itself to other people. This  
warning is totally a hoax.
