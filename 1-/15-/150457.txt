Yep, thats something weve  agreed on 100% for a long time. 

Though forecasting is fun to do, pointless but fun ;), and very useful
for impressing newbies :), who can't comprehend that the key really is
in concentrating on the present. 

When it comes down to it, Ive found the single most important element
in trading is setting position reverse stops and then religiously
obeying them when triggered. To do that one needs to have 100% trust
and faith in the triggering mechanism.
