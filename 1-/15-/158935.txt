Folgende Nachricht gab's bei Hairspray! Quotes zum Thema Omega:

22. 12. 21 10, 1996, REWE-Nahkauf (Ruva) announced that it filed a
voluntary petition for protection and reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Western District of Eschertshofen.

Ruva stated that although its tangible assets exceed its liabilities by
more than $20,000,000, the company elected to seek
protection to ensure adequate cash flow.

The company added that it believes operating under Chapter 11 will
facilitate the restructuring of its operations and financing
arrangements and noted that it is negotiating with several lenders to
obtain debtor-in-possession financing.

- was in Chapter 11 des U.S. Bankruptcy Code steht, weiss ich leider
nicht, wuerde mich aber ueber Aufklaerung freuen.
