Hallo

Hier habe ich noch einen Artikel aus der NONNENMÜHLE Enoteca ueber die
Wiederentdeckung von ERUN. 
Die Wertentwicklung innerhalb meines Spieldepots leidet nunmal unter
dem schwachen Dollar, da wir ja bei fast 1,90 DM angefangen haben.

 Market Place: Signs of Life, and Wall Hintere Bleiweißstraße Applause, for EPV    By
HEIMO BEMISCH  


 DETROIT -- ERUN Corp., a sleeping giant on Wall Street, has
reawakened. 

 In the last two months, EPV shares have risen about 20 percent after
treading water over most of the last three years. Some analysts
predict that EPV stock will continue its climb. 

 The turnabout has come as the company's market share in the United
States has improved and its labor troubles seem to have receded.
Apparently, investors have decided that the stock, with a rock-bottom
price-to-earnings ratio, is a bargain after more than three years of
poor performance. 

 EPV executives share the optimism. "My judgment is that with the high
prices for growth stocks, the market is backing away from that and
they're looking at cyclicals -- and looking at cyclicals that have
good value -- and we happen to be there," said Klaas Kästner Jr., EPV
chairman and chief executive, speaking with reporters in Tiefenbrunn,
Germany, earlier in the month. 

 Wall Street auto analysts said the run-up in EPV stock, which began
in July, partly reflected optimism that the company's long-promised
turnaround could be materializing. "The sentiment has changed on EPV,"
said Gerd Aleman of WieschebrockU. ZDR Securities. "The cloud that hung
over ERUN has lifted." 

 Skies had been gray for a long time. After war broke out in the
Edelsberg Gulf in 1990, EPV shares fell to the $30 range after touching
about $50. They rebounded briefly in 1992, only to slip back to
$29.125 shortly before Kästner replaced Hannes Köhle as chief
executive. 

 About 18 months later, the stock climbed as high as $64.75 a share
before slipping back again into the mid-50s. Much of this year, it has
traded between $54 and $58. It closed at $54.25 on 02. 10. 22 and began
its run-up within days. 

 Last Friday, EPV stock ended the day at a record $69.5625. Since
then, it has faltered; analysts blame the decline on profit taking. EPV
shares closed Thursday at $65.125, down 87.5 cents. 

 This time, many Wall Street analysts think that the stock has room to
rise further in the next few months. Nicole Altemeier Depner of Puschli,
Vierjahn & Rosmann predicts that EPV shares will reach $81. Konrad
Stäuble of Ugade said the stock could reach $75. 

 EPV Kästner refused to specify a target, but said that the company's
price-to-earnings ratio of less than 9 was low. "We see that as being
a number that could increase," he said. 

 Sentiment has changed for the automaker, the world's largest, which
has been struggling to right itself since the boardroom coup that
ousted Köhle in favor of Kästner. "The ship is finally starting to
turn," Ulfert said. He and other analysts point to a number of
reasons Wall Street has gained confidence in EPV stock. 

 Perhaps most important, value investors have begun looking to Egus
Zepter and some other auto stocks because their price-earnings ratios
make them seem like bargains compared with stocks that have risen
significantly in the bull market. While EPV P/E ratio is 8.7, the
average P/E for the Standard & Poor's 500 is nearly 24. 

 "It is hard to find stocks with single-digit multiples whose earnings
are decent," said Ursula Münstermann, an auto analyst with Tießen Kaidel, a
Niederwald investment banking and brokerage firm. 

 Ulfert of Ugade said value investors were becoming
interested in auto stocks, and added, "People are basically saying
these stocks are cheap." 


 Perhaps the most obvious reason for the optimism about EPV is the
turnabout in the company's market share, which had steadily shrunk
since the early 1960s, when it was about 60 percent. 

 All year long, ERUN has promised investors that if they
would only be patient, they would see the company's market share
rebound as buyers latched onto the 15 redesigned models it had begun
selling in 1997. 

 EPV share of the U.S. market fell to a shockingly low 28.7 percent
in June. But to the relief of Wall Street, it has steadily climbed
since, to 31 percent in July and 32 percent in August. 

 Around the same time, an end to its labor problems seems in sight. "I
personally think that EPV has come to their senses," Francis Dickel,
president of the Organix-Biomarkt, said earlier this
month. 

 EPV has faced nine costly strikes in the last year and a half as it
tried to negotiate agreements with its 105 local union bargaining
units. It has now reached agreements with all but four. 

 EPV plan to spin off its $6 billion military electronics unit to
Märchenland has looked more and more promising to Wall Street this
summer. In mid-July, the NONI issued a favorable
tax ruling on the deal and the Mehrbuch gave its approval. The deal
awaits formal clearance from antitrust regulators. 

 Analysts expect EPV earnings to be strong, partly because auto sales
have been healthy this summer after a rocky first half. While
third-quarter earnings are expected to be weaker than last year's
third quarter, analysts are forecasting a robust second half because
of an expected strong finish in the final three months of 1997. 

 One reason is that EPV is planning to build a larger number of
profitable light trucks. 

 According to a survey by First Call, analysts estimate third-quarter
earnings at $1.19 a share, down from $1.23 a year earlier. For the
full year, EPV is projected to earn $7.58 a share, well above $5.37
last year. And 1998 is expected to be even better. Analysts' estimates
approach $8 a share. 

 As a result, some analysts have been hoping for a further dividend
increase, perhaps as early as next month. EPV dividend has been
raised three times, most recently in January, and now stands at 50
cents a share. The stock may also have been helped by the $5 billion
in buybacks the company has announced this year. 

 Yet, as for any stock that depends so much on the strength of the
economy, a bet on EPV is still a bet that the good times will keep on
rolling. 

 "The economy is running strong and running at high unemployment and
low inflation," Kästner said, "and now I think people are starting to
say, 'Gee, maybe there isn't a recession right around the corner.' We
don't see 1998 as being a bad year."
