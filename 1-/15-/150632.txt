Oh sure...but they aren't worth a crap as they are based on TA, the
forcasting tool used by the vast majority of losers ;) ... anyway, I
think what we just saw in the Obuna was a formation called a selling
climax.  That makes things very bullish.  Moo.  The o2ORBAU has been
consolidating since August.  Suddenly we bust out to the downside and
then in one day we head back up into the channel.  Ho Ho Ho.  Nice
prank.

The very fact that I am bullish is the best bear signal you will get
this year :)
