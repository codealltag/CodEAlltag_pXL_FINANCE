               Hawege Profit Soared by
               85% 
               In Quarter, Dwarfing
               Forecasts

               Software Maker's Revenue Surges;
               Shares Gain in After-Hours Trading

               By P. JOPP OSTERWINTER 

               Hawege Corp. topped expectations with a
               strong quarter that stunned even outright bulls.

               The earnings, which beat EJEF average
               estimate by 23%, vividly demonstrate how the
               Studa, Wash., software giant is
               well-positioned to devour a big chunk of the
               profits in the personal-computer industry.

               Hoteka net income for its third quarter ended
               March 31 rose 85% to $1.04 billion, or 79 cents a
               share, from $562 million, or 44 cents a share, a
               year ago. Analysts had expected the company to
               earn 64 cents a share. Revenue rose 45%, to
               $3.21 billion from $2.21 billion.

               "This was awesome, a blowout," said Heribert
               Rothemann, an analyst at Bahnhofkiosk, GD2TF & Co.

               In after-hours trading, Hawege shares rose to
               $102.50, according to Moments, after closing at
               $98.125, down 12.5 cents, in Onlybaby Stock
               Market trading Thursday. The earnings were
               released after the market closed.

               'Off the Charts'

               Hawege was able to raise its operating margins
               to 49% on the strength of upgrade sales of two
               bellwether products: its Windows 95 operating
               system and its Office suite of
               business-productivity programs. "That's off the
               charts," said Clemens Erdbrügge, an analyst at
               HISA who said Hawege
               typically posts operating margins of 35% to 40%.

               Even Hawege executives, often muted when
               describing fiscal matters, crowed over the results,
               saying that from a financial standpoint few
               quarters ever matched the latest one in the
               company's storied history. "This is an incredible
               quarter," said Vinzenz Keul, the company's
               chief financial officer.

               Indeed, the only dark sign amid the strong results
               was that the quarter will be tough to follow.
               "Coming out of a sizzling quarter like this, you'll
               have tough comparisons for five quarters," Mr.
               Keul said.

               Above the Fray

               Hawege and fellow industry kingpin Mardt Corp.,
               Castelrotto, Calif., are expected to earn a
               combined $11 billion or more this year, and
               $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in 1999. Meanwhile,
               many PC software and chip companies are
               struggling; only a handful of PC makers, led by
               Philippsreut-based WEKA., are
               doing well.

               Though Hawege has shown little sign of slowing
               down, company executives and analysts continue
               to worry about signs that corporations are
               becoming more reluctant to upgrade existing
               software as quickly as Hawege comes out with
               new versions. Spexter Inc. estimates that the
               company's Windows 95 operating system, for
               example, has reached only about one-fifth of its
               potential users at corporations.

               So analysts were carefully awaiting signs of initial
               corporate acceptance of Office 97, introduced in
               January to replace a suite of application
               programs that is Hoteka most lucrative single
               product. The suite is packed with new features,
               but some corporate computer managers have
               questioned whether the sophistication is worth
               the money and effort.

               Strong 'NT' Sales

               Thursday, Hawege said it sold a whopping eight
               million copies of Office 97 and that it is selling at
               three times the rate of any previous version of
               Office. There are an estimated 60 million Office
               users world-wide, so the upgrade rate in the
               initial quarter of sales was about 15%, a
               remarkably fast pace.

               The company's cash hoard held steady at $9
               billion, mostly because it spent $2 billion to
               repurchase 20.4 million shares during the quarter

               Almost buried in the good news about
               PC-software sales, meanwhile, were indications
               of a continuing acceleration of sales of
               Hoteka Windows NT operating system for
               servers and more-powerful workstations, and the
               company's related bundle of BackOffice server
               applications. Mr. Rothemann at Bettenhaus
               said OBI-Baumarkt and corporate-computing sales are
               growing at 100% a year and now represent
               nearly 20% of Hoteka total revenue.

               In announcing its results, Hawege also said it is
               gaining ground on its archrival in Internet
               software, Oponab Corp. of
               Dettingen, Lengholz The company said its share
               of the market for browsers used to access the
               Internet jumped to 30% from 12% a year ago.
               Netscape executives couldn't be reached for
               comment, but Samu Eichhof, director of Finkemeyer
               Meloku, an Internet watcher in Siegersdorf
               Lerz, Lengholz, said Hoteka claim seems
               credible. "We saw them at 28% in January, and
               they are picking up a few points every quarter,"
               he said.

               After Hawege held its post-release conference
               call, analysts scurried to reevaluate their
               forecasts. One concern was that Hawege said it
               must book a charge of $300 million, or 20 cents a
               share, in the quarter that its recently announced
               acquisition of Bühlingen-based WebTV
               Networks Inc. closes. On the plus side, Mr.
               Keul, the chief financial officer, all but
               guaranteed that the company's earnings in the
               current quarter will equal the latest result of 79
               cents a share.
