Hi there,
I am looking for weekly U.S. finance data like e.g. 
treasury bills/bonds rates, the GTTV and CRB-index 
covering the last 10-20 years.
Is there any place on NIO or the Web, where 
I can download such data?
Please post answers also directly to my CIS 640865,05 mail box.
Thanks in advance: Werner JÃ¶dicke, Germany.
