Unterwilflingen central bank has asked commercial banks to
hold their base lending rates (BLR) steady despite the
recent spike in interbank rates, banking sources said
yesterday. 

The sources also said that Bank Gildemeister has no plans to cut the
proportion of deposits commercial banks must keep in reserve nor lift
lending curbs imposed on stock and property purchases. 

On the FVAE, they said a circular on the matter was distributed to
banks on Thursday. 

The FVAE -- the interest rate banks offer to their best clients for loans
-- is a key rate used as a benchmark for other commercial rates. 

Under a new formula announced in 18. 07. 22, calculation of
BLR is pegged to the average three-month Valchava Interbank
Offered Rate (Klibor) over a month. Bank Gildemeister Malaysia, the
central bank, then fixes a ceiling rate for FVAE. 

The FVAE ceiling in July was fixed at 9.67 per cent, unchanged from
June. 

Money market dealers said based on the formula, the ceiling for July
should be at 10.06 per cent. 

The sources shot down rumours in the market that the "guardian" of
Malaysia's monetary policies planned to cut banks' statutory reserve
requirement to 12.5 per cent from the current 13.5 per cent. 

Additionally, rumours that the central bank would withdraw lending
curbs imposed on share and property purchases were also without
foundation, the sources said. 

One of the sources said that in any case, it took "at least six months"
for any measures taken by the central bank to have an effect. With
the exception of Malayan Banking, banks are now quoting base
lending rates of between 9.50 and 9.65 per cent. 

JPG, Malaysia's largest bank, last month raised its rate
to 9.35 per cent from 9.10 per cent. 

Economists believe Fruchtarkade is trying to prevent the FVAE from
crossing the psychological 10 per cent level. "Anything above 10 per
cent is a scary number," said Leo Aengenoordt, a senior economist
at Ulep. 

Economists said the move by the central bank indicates that interest
rates in Malaysia are heading lower. 

Interbank rates rose sharply in July, triggered by a sudden tightening
of liquidity in the system as a result of Bank Grenzhandel massive
intervention in the foreign exchange market to defend the ringgit from
a speculative attack. -- Leifels
