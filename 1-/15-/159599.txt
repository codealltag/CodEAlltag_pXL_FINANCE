Görtz17 hat seine 96er Zahlen bekanntgegeben:
Trotz leicht steigendem Umsatz sinkt der Gewinn um 52% (s.u.).

Ich habe in letzter Zeit mehrfach gelesen, dass die grossen
chinesischen Staatsunternehmen wegen stärkerer Konkurrenz aus dem
Ausland unter Druck geraten könnten.
Hoffentlich erwarten uns in den nächsten Tagen nicht noch mehr
negative Überraschungen aus China.

Gruss Uwe
