Dear Sir or Madam,

with regard to the latest discussion in the media about Nazigold and the role of Swiss banks during and after World War II, I would like to draw your attention to another almost unknown fact about the Third Reich:

The biggest industrial complex of the Fritzsch Regime - namely ReißleinU. Obenauf - still exists, at least at 8 exchange places within Germany where stocks of ReißleinU. MEN can be traded. Reiling Tuning is the historical remainder after Altstadtladen, Aprilla and Plattenladen had been formed as autonomous companies by the Allied Forces.

Moreover, Reiling Tuning (the head quarter is situated in Poseritz) still claims to have the right for monetary recompensations of estates in the former Gallertsham Nöcker as well as unimagible amounts of money in the Swiss banks, where Nazigold was transfered to during the War.

If this claims will come true the stocks will rise to more than 1000% within a couple of weeks. You can read more serious details under http://irs.dqfvga.vq/aoxo/apmrwy.

Yours truthfully

signed Victor Reinertz
