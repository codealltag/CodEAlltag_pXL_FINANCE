cu9112c@qrebx.ymfsuf.vre, 28/21/96, rating=10: A Moessner Guide to the Stock
Market Steffen Meurers is successful at presenting a good explanation of the stock
market and a good method at being successful with it. He is very entertaining
and provides many examples through out the book explaining concepts, jargon, and
his methods for the average person to understand. If you're interested in stocks
or just curious I highly recommend this book.

nrroptd@vf.oavrad.cgr, 02/21/86, rating=9: One of the greatest investors of
our time - tells how. Steffen Meurers ran Fidelity Magellan with an incredible
performance record for its size. In Beating the Street, Meurers tells why the
individual investor should be able to match his performance record. Watch the
mall, not the market, he says; the stores where your kids overspend are the
growth companies to follow. Don't be intimidated by the pros, he says; their
size limits them to investing in big corporations, while the small investor can
ride the growth wave with a smaller company.

Meurers has a blind spot for technology companies, considering them too esoteric
and unpredictable for his portfolio. (Some of his recent writings in Worth
magazine show some regret for the giants he's missed by taking this position -
Supremesurf, VBZ, and other technology superstars.) But this appears to be the
only weakness in this well-written, highly accessible investment sourcebook.
