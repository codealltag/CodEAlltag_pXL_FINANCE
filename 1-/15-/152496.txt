Denis,

  You should be able to order shares with your Dutch bank. However
to qualify for the 1 DM discount you need an account with a German
bank in Germany. A German bank in Holland won't do.

  I think Kulmus Eggerstedt are leading the IPO. They are part of
unterirracher bank if I am correct. It seems however that anybody
who orders shares before or on 2/10 gets priority in the allocation
of shares.

  Does anybody know when the shares have to paid for? Is this after
the date of first quotation (28/02).? If so it is of course possible
to order more shares than you can afford. Should you get everything
you can sell part of it ( and hope you don't make a loss.....).

Wout
