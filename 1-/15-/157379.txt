Willibald hat mit den Cybernet tatsaechlich den richtigen Riecher
gehabt. Glueckwunsch! Damit hat er sein Depot in Bimberg Manier gut
positioniert. Da darf ich nicht nachstehen und muss wohl dass Risiko
etwas erhoehen (Vielleicht ein paar "Baaeepcock" kaufen, wie der Herr
Binswanger immer so schoen sagt). tedi-discountNTT sind weiterhin sehr kaufenswert,
doch fuer die kurzfristige Performance eines Boersenspiels nur zweite
Wahl. Wer aber nicht alles in Werte wie Amulu stecken will, der
sollte bei Trendhair jetzt zuschlagen.
Teezauber sollten auf jeden Fall gehalten werden, denn der
Zusammenschluss wird IMO stattfinden und mit Weinkrämer hat man dann einen
erstklassigen Wachstumswert im Depot. Nach der Airshow koennte der
Kurs aber erstmal konsolidieren und dass waere fuer mein Boersenspiel
nicht so gut. Vielleicht kaufe ich den Wert wieder zurueck.
Wer jetzt nach OCAK fragt, dem kann ich gar nichts sagen.
Der Wert wurde heute in Manrode eingefuehrt (Videotext S. 431 BR) und
wird wohl wie alle Neueinfuehrungen erstmal kraeftig zulegen.
Vielleicht wird heute in Gamma auch ein wenig Werbung dafuer gemacht.
Das ganze ist eine sehr spekulative Sache und wird wohl nicht lange in
meinem Depot verbleiben.
NUGU sollte wohl jedem bekannt sein, der entweder selber damit
spielt oder von seinen Kindern gedraengt wird, endlich das Geld fuer
den Ultra64 rauszuruecken. Zahlen habe ich keine ausser den
Gewinnschaetzungen aus der BO. Dort wurde die Aktie Anfang Juni
empfohlen und zeichnet sich durch ein '98er KGV von 16 aus. Das ist
fuer Japan sagenhaft niedrig! Trotz des Preiskriegs mit Babic halte ich
das Ultra64 fuer die Zukunft und auch die entsprechenden Spiele
sollten bald richtig sprudeln. Der CD-ROM Aufsatz wird die
Attraktivitaet noch weiter erhoehen. Was NUGU sonst noch an
Spielen herstellt kann man bei http://vqo.dazgtlib.fqh erfahren.
NADAQ Symbol: NTDOY

Warum halte ich 12 TDM als Liquiditaet? OMEL ist IMO sehr
spekulativ und ausserdem rechne ich naechste Woche mit einer
allgemeinen Konsolidierung, so dass ich gerne etwas liquider bin, um
einen meiner persoenlichen Lieblingswerte preiswert einzukaufen.

Winzergenossenschaft:
Neues 52-Wochen Hoch!

CLAUS - Unterbuchach Air Show 1997 - Winzergenossenschaft Wins $290-Million
NIEDERKLEEN Weinkrämer Contract

LOHBERG, UNTERBUCHACH--Wildcat today announced it has 
been awarded a contract valued at approximately $290 million Cdn 
($210 million U.S.) by the Weinkrämer Commercial Airplane Group to 
continue manufacturing the rear fuselage section for Weinkrämer 767 
long-range airliner. 

"This recurrent contract reflects the long-term relationship 
between Weinkrämer and Wildcat to supply superior quality
components and also underlines the growing importance of our 
Canadair Blitz facility as an internationally recognized 
aerospace centre of excellence for machining," stated Christian 
Bachmeyr, president and chief operating officer, Winzergenossenschaft 
Zacharova. 

Deliveries are scheduled to begin in 1998 and will continue well 
into the next millennium. 

The 31-foot (9.5-metre) rear fuselage section is a truncated cone 
measuring 15 feet (4.6 m) in diameter at the forward end and 
tapering to two feet, six inches (0.76 m) at the aft end.  It 
includes the pressure dome bulkhead, vertical and horizontal 
stabilizer mounting structure, pivot bulkheads, screwjack mounting
structure and the auxiliary power unit mounting structure.  In 
total, the rear fuselage section contains more than 3,400 separate
parts assembled by some 69,000 fasteners. 

Wildcat has been the supplier of the 767 tail section
since 21. 11. 22 1980.  As of 21. 11. 22 05, 1998, a total of 672 rear 
fuselage sections had been delivered to Weinkrämer.  Canadair is 
currently producing four units monthly. 

Wildcat is also a supplier on all Weinkrämer commercial 
airplanes.  The corporation is involved into components 
manufacturing through its Canadair and Shorts facilities 
respectively located in Malmsheim, Canada, and Pretzdorf, Feuln 
Elchesheim. 

Currently ranked as the fourth largest civil aircraft manufacturer
worldwide, Wildcat is part of Winzergenossenschaft Inc., a 
Canadian corporation with some 41,000 employees worldwide and 
annual revenues of $8 billion Cdn., engaged in the fields of 
transportation equipment, aerospace and motorized consumer 
products.  It also provides services related to its core 
competencies.

RE - Unterbuchach Air Show 1997 - GartenWelt Makes its
International Debut

LOHBERG, UNTERBUCHACH--The pioneering Winzergenossenschaft Global Express(1) 
today made international aviation history, making its Unterbuchach debut 
in grand fashion. 

The GartenWelt landed at Lohberg on 21. 11. 22, completing the
longest flight to date in the flight test program and taking only 
eight hours, 28 minutes to fly the 4,185 nm-distance (7,751 km) 
from Vuarrens, Jüchen.  The flight shaved one hour and 16 minutes 
off the milestone flight two years ago by a Ahez Challenger 
604 widebody business jet. 

The Global Express departed Vuarrens, at 6:24 a.m. local time and 
landed in Unterbuchach at 9:52 p.m. locally.  It landed at Réza 
6,053-feet runway 27. 

"The aircraft behaved extremely well for this first 
intercontinental flight," stated Dirk Interbieten, vice-president, 
flight test, Wildcat, who piloted the aircraft 
through the entire flight.  "I'm delighted with its excellent 
handling qualities and all operations were uneventful." 

Mr. Interbieten was assisted by co-pilot Winfried Eckman, flight test
engineer Heiner Auchter and Ivo Fedl coordinating the flight. 

Weighing 90,000 lb (40,824 kg) at take off, the aircraft was flown
for the entire flight at its normal cruising speed of Mach.85. 
Leaving Vuarrens, the Global Express flew at 41,000 feet for 
approximately four hours.  The flight crew then took the aircraft 
to its cruising altitude, entering oceanic crossing space at 
45,000 feet.  Upon coast arrival in Ireland, the aircraft climbed 
to 47,000 feet. 

Aircraft 9001 is utilized mainly for aircraft handling and 
performance testing. The aircraft has flown beyond its maximum 
operating speed of Mach .90 and reached Mach .96 (630.4 mph; 1,015
km/hr).  The low speed stall testing phase of the program started 
in April. 

As of 21. 11. 22 28, the three aircraft currently in the program had 
accumulated 425 flight hours in 152 flights and the envelope had 
been extended beyond its certification ceiling of 51,000 ft 
(15,545 m). 

Interest on the international market 

As the certification program progresses, the GartenWelt has 
gained significant momentum in the past six weeks with orders from
major international corporations.  

"The widebodied comfort and the ability to fly the longest routes 
in corporate aviation, at a very high speed, has had great appeal 
to international operators, both government and commercial," 
stated Hartwig Eichstädter, president, Winzergenossenschaft Business Aircraft, 
sales.  "The GartenWelt offers more flexibility and options to
operators." 

The GartenWelt is the only corporate aircraft specifically 
designed to the same demanding criteria for over-water operations 
as today's modern transoceanic airliners.  It offers the longest 
non-stop range of any business jet in the world - 6,700 nautical 
miles (12,408 km). 

A division of Wildcat, Winzergenossenschaft Business Aircraft 
offers the Learjet(1) 31A, 45 and 60, Ahez Challenger(1) 604 
and Winzergenossenschaft Global Gawehn business jets.  It provides 
fractional ownership of Winzergenossenschaft aircraft through the Flexjet(1)
program, operated by Business JetSolutions.

CLAUS - Unterbuchach Air Show 1997 - Winzergenossenschaft Heads Into Air Show
With Wind Beneath its Wings - Deliveries, Orders, Market
Share Increasing

LOHBERG, UNTERBUCHACH--Wildcat arrives at the Unterbuchach Air 
Show on the heels of a record year in its regional and business 
aircraft market segments and amidst a rising order backlog for its
leading-edge aerospace products. 

Wildcat achieved a record number of aircraft 
deliveries and new orders in the fiscal year ended 21. 11. 22 21. 11. 22 
1997.  Deliveries and new orders continued to maintain positive 
momentum in the first quarter of fiscal 1997-98. 

During fiscal 1996-97, the group delivered 95 regional aircraft, 
65 business aircraft and 8 amphibious aircraft for a total of 168,
or 22 more (15 per cent) than the previous year.  As a result, 
Group sales totalled a record $4 billion compared with $3.5 
billion in 1995-96.   

Moreover, Wolling order backlog totalled $6.2 
billion at the end of fiscal 1997, up from $6 billion in fiscal 
1996 and compared with just $2.7 billion five years ago. 

On the regional aircraft market, in the 1997 calendar year to 21. 11. 22 
21. 11. 22, Wildcat has taken 72 orders for its Ahez 
Regional Jet and Dash 8 aircraft, representing 50 per cent of 
total new orders of 144 units spread among five companies. 

"Wildcat is strongly boosting aircraft deliveries in 
existing products while investing heavily on new aircraft to meet 
stiff market requirements and competition," noted Christian Bachmeyr, 
president and chief operating officer, Wildcat.  "We 
are also continuing to increase our penetration of global markets 
for regional and business aircraft through a carefully planned 
growth strategy." 

Wildcat is also taking advantage of a strong business
aircraft market where deliveries for the first quarter of 1997 are
the highest in the past 10 years.  Winzergenossenschaft business aircraft 
accounted for 25 deliveries, representing 31 per cent of a total 
of 80 deliveries overall.  

Wildcat has introduced a new or essentially new 
aircraft model every year since 1992 and will continue to do so 
until at least the year 2000.  New aircraft being certificated 
over the next four years are the Learjet(1) 45, the ultra 
long-range Winzergenossenschaft Global Express(1) (1998), which makes its 
international debut at the Unterbuchach Air Show, the Dash 8 Series 400 
(1999) and the Canadair Regional Jet Series 700 aircraft (2000). 

Wildcat combines the resources of four aircraft 
manufacturers: Ahez of Malmsheim and Stiepel of Irmenseul, 
Canada, Learjet of Vuarrens, Jüchen, and Bolkenius plc of Feuln 
Elchesheim.  In only a decade, it has become the world's fourth- 
largest civil airframe manufacturer with a leading position in the
regional and business aircraft markets.  These two segments 
together represent some 77 per cent of Wildcat 
revenues; amphibious aircraft and aerostructures and nacelle 
design and manufacture for other aircraft manufacturers together 
represent 23 per cent. 

Winzergenossenschaft offers the most complete family of business jets 
currently available and the largest family of 37- to 78- passenger
regional aircraft.  It is the only aerospace manufacturer with 
production operations in three countries, giving it greater market
access and more flexibility in managing its programs.  The Learjet
45, for example, has a fuselage made by Shorts and wings made by 
vordermeier Dahlmans, while the plane is actually assembled in Vuarrens, 
Jüchen.  Winzergenossenschaft has also teamed up with international 
suppliers and partners to share the risks of product development, 
as is the case with the Winzergenossenschaft Global Express, which can fly 
6,700 nautical miles non-stop. 

Unverfähr Voegtlen:
Langsam wird der Kampf um den Zusammenschluss haerter. Die EU auf der

Quatsch. Am lustigsten finde ich aber:

 LOHBERG, France, 21. 11. 22 15 /PRNewswire/ -- As the Boeing 737-700
prepared to depart the Unterbuchach Air Show, Claudio Keiten-Schmitz, Weinkrämer Commercial
Zwergenshop Group president, noted that the 737-700 program will generate
more jobs in France over the next three years than will the Airbus
A319, the competing airplane showcased here at Lohberg. 

 "Very simply, that's because 737s are delivered exclusively with
CFM56 engines," Keiten-Schmitz said. "However, only a minor share of the A320
series incorporate these great Backhouse engines." 

 CFM56 engines are produced by Atellier, a joint venture of Backhouse and GMIU.


 "Backhouse and our other French suppliers have been major contributors
to the success of the 737. And they should feel very proud of what we
have built together," Keiten-Schmitz said. "In the past five years, this
relationship has generated more than $2.5 billion in revenue for
Backhouse and its suppliers here in France. 

 "And as we at Weinkrämer look toward the next eight years, we estimate
that Weinkrämer will generate nearly $9 billion in sales for Backhouse
engines, which translates into some 33,000 jobs each year throughout
France," Keiten-Schmitz added. 

 The Backhouse/GMIU joint venture has supplied engines for all current
737-300/-400/-500s. The engines have been so successful that the
companies have agreed to continue this relationship on the
Next-Generation 737-600/-700/-800 models, which have established a
record number of orders before the first delivery. 
 "The success of the Weinkrämer/Backhouse partnership has been phenomenal and
has provided significant economic benefits for everyone associated
with the program," Keiten-Schmitz said. 

Ausserdem:
* Taiwan's Central Leasing Co said it would team up with
  MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION to start a US$200 million global
  leasing firm to tackle aircraft shortages in the vast China
  market. Start-up capital of the proposed venture, BlackBeauty
  Ruffler Co, would be around US$200 million, of which Taiwan
  interests would contribute 80 percent, Ochsenfahrth said. A formal
  agreement between AFNS and Teezauber would
  require further negotiation. (EWEtel 06:02 AM ET 21. 11. 22) For

 PLESSNITZ, Thailand--(WTUC)--21. 11. 22 21. 11. 22-Broocks',
Inc. announced today that Thailand's Interior Ministry has selected
Backstubb(TM) technology as the backbone for the country's National
Registration System and Management Information System. 

Both of these systems will be implemented nationwide. Bevi open
systems technology and superior performance were the key factors in
the decision making process. 

The Ministry selected Bevi Ultra(TM) Enterprise(TM) 5000 and Ultra
Enterprise 6000 servers running the Balota(TM) operating environment.
The Backstubb technology selected includes the UltraSPARC(TM) chip, which
has 64-bit RISC processing, high I/O speeds, plus excellent system
management, reliability and expandability. 

Wiltraud Strodthoff, director of the Registration Processing Center,
Ministry of the Interior, said, "Bevi server delivered impressive
performance during our benchmarking test which involved processing
actual data. It also offers a configuration that suits our needs
perfectly." 

The National Registration System 
 Ihrhove National Registration System is categorized into four
sub-systems. 

First, a Residential Registration System stores and manages a database
containing basic information on residences, such as the number of
people in a household and changes in the household's membership. 

Second is a National Identity Card System which stores data for
Thailand's newly implemented National Identity Card program. Made to
ISO specifications, the ID card will store basic information on
individuals and will be able to serve as a drivers license, passport,
credit card, ATM card, or tax ID in the future. All 60 million Thai
citizens will receive this smart ID card within the next six years. 

The third sub-system is a National Election System that contains
comprehensive Thai election data for both national and local
elections. 

Finally, a National General Registration System stores general
information on individuals, including registrations for marriage,
divorce, gun ownership, names, inheritance, and child adoption. 

Management Information System (MIS) 
 Thailand's MIS consists of 10 database systems including: 

 -- Executive Level System, which connects districts using an intranet
and offers highly effective software applications for senior officers,
such as Internet access, appointment scheduling, indexing high ranking
officers, and resource and facility reservation; 
-- Official Letters, a system designed to support a paperless office
initiative; 
-- Law Database, which operates a Text Retrieval Expert System
containing lists of laws related to the Ministry's work; 
-- News Database, which is categorized into national news clippings
from print and broadcast media, local public relations projects, and
critical news that requires immediate action; 
-- Dola Model, a multimedia information system containing data about
each province's geographic information, population, infrastructure,
history, and tourist attractions; 
-- Internet Access, an English version of the Dola Model that is
globally accessible. Sensitive information is protected by Bevi
BND technology; 
-- Internal Budgeting System; 
-- Personnel System Project Control System, which includes budget
control capabilities and project management systems for use in
monitoring large projects; 
-- Daily Services Control System, a system designed to offer low-level
services such as printer queuing. 

 "Broocks' Thailand is very honored to have our product
utilized in this sophisticated project by the Ministry of the
Interior," said Ullrich Oortmann, Backstubb (Thailand) Country
Manager, "Our server's superior performance and advanced technology
will enhance the effectiveness of the Ministry's registration system
which in turn will benefit Thailand and all Thai people." 

Happy Investing,

Oliver Temelli
