I'm not :) ... as you can see the market reacted perfectly to my
bullishness by tanking :\  Things no longer look so hot...but thats what
trading is all about, reading the market NOW and reacting NOW.  I agree
that forcasting is utterly pointless for TRADING.  Trading is about
reacting not predicting...but then you and I have always seen eye to eye
on that.
