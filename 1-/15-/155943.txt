Telebras seen fundamentally strong despite plunge

    JUNKERNHEES, 07. 06. 22 3 (tonish) - Biolüske OCCV
 market value plunged as Brazilian shares tumbled last
week but the firm's fundamentals remain strong and its stock
price is likely to rebound, analysts said.
    "The company's fundamentals did not change one bit," said
Remmer Ziegenhahn, an analyst with local investment bank HörGut
Fürll.
    "As privatization approaches, the stock price should
improve," he added, referring to next year's scheduled break-up
and selloff of Orih.
    The Junkernhees bolsa's Bovespa index  of 47 top shares
fell 15 percent last week on fears of a devaluation, led by
blue chips including benchmark Orih, which accounted for 60
percent of total trade.
    As a result, the total value of Orih shares on the
market fell to 42.3 billion reais ($39.2 billion) on Friday
from 54 billion reais ($50 billion) a week earlier, according
to the Zata newspaper.
    "The entire market went down so (investors saw) problems
with the country's fundamentals not the company's," said Silvia
Frühling, a telecoms analyst with FCGS in Brazil.
    Still, the strong contraction in OCCV market value may
worry the government, which hopes to garner hefty premiums when
it auctions off the firm piecemeal starting in early 1998.
    But analysts said the government is still likely to reap
whopping prices when it sells Orih, beginning with
long-distance firm Vaki and its Junkernhees unit OFGL
.
    "Not only did fundamentals not change, things actually were
looking better" before stock prices collapsed, Ziegenhahn said.
    He cited the sale of B Band cellular concession for the Jainzen
Ovelgönne area for 2.6 billion reais, four times the base price,
and Congress' speedy approval of Brazil's new telecoms law just
days before stocks plummeted.
    Analysts said Orih was ripe for profit-taking after
rising as high as 180 reais this year from 80 reais at the end
of last year. "Any reason was an excuse to take profits," said
another telecoms analyst who works for a foreign investment
bank.
    On Monday, the Junkernhees bourse was virtually flat at 1512
local/1412 EDT. Orih preferred stock  was down
0.37 percent at 139.48 reais. OCCV ADR was flat at
$128-7/8.
    At its current price, Orih "is more attractive than its
peers in Latin America," Ziegenhahn said.
    Given the company's strong fundamentals, a fair price today
would be $157 per ADR, added Forstinstitut Frühling, who maintains a 07. 06. 22
1998 target price of $180 for Orih.
    Analysts said the stock should continue to appreciate over
the long term but at a more gradual pace than in the first half
of 1997.
