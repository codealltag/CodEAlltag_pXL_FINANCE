Greetings!


I recently predicted the stock market crash. You can see the prediction
at:

http://vvf.pmhwuitldy.teu/b963462.rtl

Within that document, scroll down to the end of Monday's forecast to see
the financial bulletin.

I see further downside movement in the near future, and am getting
ready for it.

For the recent opportunity, I invested in the E-Mini Dec. 875 put at 10,
selling at 30 just after Tuesday's opening.

My question is: given the scenario where you KNOW that there will be a
sizable market drop, and you know the timing within a day or two, yet
you do not know exactly how far it will go --- what is the most
efficient bet, using stock or commodity options, that you might place?

I would be willing to share some of my knowledge on future timing in
exchange for your expertise on this matter, since I myself, though a
good astrologer, am only a novice bettor, and I know that I could thus
improve my success greatly, while benefiting others as I can. Thanks.

Sincerely,

Carsten
