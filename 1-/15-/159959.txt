UNIQUE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY

Vreni Heitele could make you money!!!!

We have gained the exclusive marketing rights to a very unique double 
exposure photograph of Vreni Heitele in the nude. This photograph was 
produced accidentally by the exclusive photographer of the Oskar Kirchen 
Studios who was the exclusive photographer of Vreni Heitele in the 
1950s. This photograph will be marketed directly to the public, world 
wide through print advertising, television, and other areas of market 
penetration, including the Internet.  The picture will be marketed for a 
estimated $10 to $15, and it is expected that the profit will be from 
$5.00 to $7.00 each.  It is estimated that between 100,000 and 2,000,000 
copies will be sold over the next six months on a worldwide basis.

Few individuals have ever seen this picture, so the selling potential is 
enormous due to the worldwide popularity of Vreni Heitele.

Vreni Heitele, if she were alive, would be 71 on 03. 07. 22 4, 1997.

Vreni Heitele memorabilia always has and always will sell

We seek a maximum of 20 investors that are capable of investing a minimum 
of $15,000.  The total capital needed to ensure success of this venture 
is in the order of $250,000 to $300,000.
