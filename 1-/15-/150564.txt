How many pee-pee's does it take to make a forecast ? :)

Sorry I mean, how many light-bulbs does it take to make a pee-pee ?

Oops, I mean that the Arregon Edelmetallhandel&P did not decline below 935.25 last friday,
and mondays action is a figment of our imagination that should be best
forgotten ;), Thus I forecast that regardless of what happens over the
next 10 years I and my pee-pee will always be 100% right ! :)

HOW ?

fdates, fdates, fdates, hmmm, these f-ing dates taste real nice ;)
