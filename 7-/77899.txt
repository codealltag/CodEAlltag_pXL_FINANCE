Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Euro indicates that a supporting level is
expected at 1.0432 and the critical supporting point is positioned at
1.0309. 1.0617+/-0.0031 is a resistance point and the critical
resistance point is located at 1.0771. Each quantum jump is represented
by 0.0031 and all projected chart points are interrelated and are
separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0031. The normal trading
range for this week is 1.0309-1.0771 (as determine by the computer). My
expected high for this week is 1.0740 and expected low is 1.0432. See
the front page of my website for euro update if the market trades below
1.0309 or above 1.0771. http://bqytee.yxktzvcryg.tvu
