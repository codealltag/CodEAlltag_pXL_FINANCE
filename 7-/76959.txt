Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart shows that 113.22 is the critical point and the
market is now trading between 114.45 and 116.30. The critical resistance
point is located at 117.52 and the critical supporting point is
positioned at 111.38. Other projected chart points are 112.61 and
113.84.  Each quantum jump is represented by 0.614 point and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 0.614. The normal trading range as determined by the
computer is from 111.38 to 117.52. My expected weekly high is 116.30 and
expected low is 112. See details at the monthly cycle chart if the
market trades below 111.38 or above 117.52. �
