We have recently started a free newsletter with the aim of using the
combined
awareness of the readership to try and source proven high class systems
(daytrading, financial, gambling, roulette).
People who create such systems do not usually sell them as if they do they
lose control of something that is dear to them, so they tend to expose them
through the medium of a syndicate or a subscription service.
I am personally betting on 6 such systems, none of which I have created
myself. I give details of them in the newsletter and update the results each
month
(3 of the systems are now oversubscribed, so I only mention them as a guide
to what is possible).If any of you would like to join the search for the
Twartz then please
