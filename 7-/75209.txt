The daily cycle chart of Hutmode shows that 10860 is the critical
supporting point. Other projected chart points are 10890 and 10921.
Resistance points are positioned at 10981 and 11042. Each quantum jump
is represented by 30 points and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 30
points. The daily normal trading range as determined by the computer is
10860-11042. My expected daily high is 10981 and the expected daily low
is 10890.  See details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades
above 11042 or below 10860.
