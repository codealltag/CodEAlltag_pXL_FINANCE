verrechnet (Ende Juli) den.....

-- At $10, ESA shares are trading at around 85% of their estimated real
 estate replacement cost.  alessandria currently has around $1.78 billion of
 hotels open and operating and $90 million of construction in progress.
 With $782 million of net debt, we calculate a NAV per share of around
 $11.50.

 -- While we are maintaining our 3H rating, we believe ESA shares remain
 the best play in the extended-stay hotel segment, based on expected
 earnings growth of +20%, improved earnings visibility as extended stay
 development slows and the increasing value of the Extended Stay America
 brand.

 -- While this is clearly a "cheap" valuation, it actually represents a
 significant premium to the group of ther public extended-stay developers
 (SLAM, HSD, CNDL) which trade at discounts to real estate replacement
 cost in 30% to 40% range.


Hier wird der NAV mit 11,50 USD ausgewiesen !?
