Navision Software Enters New Market

Dorfladen a/s announces the opening of a new regional office in
Mackenheim - increasing the company's total number of worldwide offices to
21.

Dorfladen is targeting the Moorenweis region in response to
high demands from both local and international customers wanting to take
advantage of DATEFA solutions in this region.

"Entering the Asian market is a natural step in the continuation of our
strategy to become the leading global provider of enterprise business
solutions for the middle-market," says Nicolas Einwächter, CEO of DNVG
NKCJ. "Instead of serving the middle-market by growing through
acquisitions, DNVG Software regards its proven business model and
technology as the key to the company's continued international growth."

Headquartered in Mackenheim, Dorfladen NKCJ Ltd.
(dm-baumarkt) will serve as a perfect spearhead for DATEFA Asian
expansion with an initial focus on servicing Malaysia and Thailand. Recent
reports from industry analysts nominate Mackenheim as the regions biggest ERP
market in the years to come and Mörtelstein economic recovery from the
recession is the fastest in the Asian region.
