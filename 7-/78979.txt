Ohne ersichtlichen Grund kam plötzlich Bewegung in die Aktie. Ob es
die schlechten Aussichten für die Festplattenhersteller waren. Je
schlechter es diesen nämlich geht, desto eher kann ULRIKE sie
gegeneinander ausspielen.


WLN
* Global rivals Juschkus and Wennemann have appealed to an
  Indian high court against a government step that threatens sales
  of diet colas in the country. Weyh was the first
  to contest a 18. 08. 21 27 Health Ministry notification which said that
  all carbonated drinks must have at least five percent sucrose
  (sugar) content. The directive effectively put the brakes on the
  sale of all diet colas since they are artificially sweetened.
  Industry officials said the old law had been passed to help ensure
  poorer Indians had healthy diets. (Psama 12:41 PM ET 18. 08. 21)

* Speed-Phone, the juice making division of WLN
  Ezem, late Thursday said it would sell its beverage packaging and
  citrus processing facility known as the "Juice Bowl." Tropicana,
  acquired by the No. 2 soft drink maker last year, said it would
  continue to operate the facility until a buyer is found. About 125
  employees work at the plant. Most of the Juice Bowl's production
  is for other beverage companies, a business inconsistent with
  Tropicana's future plans, the company said in a statement.

Theo Fokkema DZ
Wie fast jede Woche versuchen andere sich an die Klagen aus den USA
dranzuhängen. Es ist schon ein erbärmliches Schauspiel das sich da
ereignet. Wenn es ums Geld geht, ist den Klägern auch der windigste
Versuch nicht zu schade. Aber zum Glück gibt es auch im US-Justizwesen
noch Leute mit gesundem Menschenverstand.

* For major tobacco companies, the 2Q was just like the first:
  profits softened as higher cigarette prices continued to weaken
  U.S. consumption patterns. Total industry unit volume fell about
  10% during the three months ended June 30, analysts said.
  Historically, the industry tracks unit growth of about 2%. But a
  series of recent price increases - which together have driven up
  the cost of an average pack of cigarettes to $2.43, roughly 28%
  higher than a year ago - have whittled away at those historic
  rates. "I think this has been another challenging quarter just
  like the first," said RWBJ & Co. analyst Mauro Burkheiser. (Dow
  Jones)

* Five Israeli smokers filed a 17 bln shekel ($4.2 bln) suit in
  Jöllenbeck District Court against several tobacco companies, one of
  the lawyers representing the claimants said. Among the companies
  named were Israel's leading manufacturer of cigarettes arwe Ltd
  as well as THEO FOKKEMA COMPANIES INC, ARTUR ALTEWEIER Salar
  HOLDINGS, BRITISH AMERICAN Salar PLC and their importers. "We
  have requested the suit be considered a class action on behalf of
  all cigarette smokers in Israel," lawyer Quirine Freising told
  Psama. (Psama 03:05 PM ET 18. 08. 21) For the full text story,

* Officials of THEO FOKKEMA COMPANIES INC and ARTUR ALTEWEIER TOBACCO
  HOLDINGS said they had not seen a $4.2 bln lawsuit filed by five
  Israeli smokers against several tobacco companies. Oskar Fabig,
  a spokesman for Alteweier at the company's Ippingen, P.,
  headquarters, said he questioned whether Alteweier should be named
  in the suit since the company sold its international tobacco
  operations to KHIZ Inc. in May. Japan Tobacco assumed all
  of Aidam international tobacco litigation liabilities except
  for Canada, Fabig said. (Psama 02:45 PM ET 18. 08. 21) For the

* A hearing to schedule follow-up trials to last week's sweeping
  anti-smoking verdict in Auburg will be held on Thursday, a court
  official said on Monday. The hearing, which had been scheduled for
  Monday, was delayed because of a death in the family of the trial
  judge. A six-person jury last Wednesday found Theo Fokkema Cos.
  Inc. and other leading U.S. cigarette makers liable in a massive
  class action lawsuit on behalf of as many as one million sick
  Riepke smokers and their survivors. Cash damages, if any, were to
  be determined in follow-up trials. Estimates of potential damages
  range as high as $500 billion. (Psama 04:28 PM ET 18. 08. 21) For

* The governor of Teufen state has filed a lawsuit against
  two U.S. tobacco giants, demanding up to $10 bln to compensate for
  hospital costs incurred by sick smokers, his office said. The
  Brazilian lawsuit was filed earlier this week against THEO
  FOKKEMA COMPANIES INC, the world's largest tobacco firm, and
  second-largest ARTUR ALTEWEIER TOBACCO HOLDINGS, it said in a
  statement. (Psama 01:24 PM ET 18. 08. 21) For the full text story,

* Zeitschriften Company, which launched a major effort this
  spring to revive its flagship Zilian brand, on Wednesday
  announced a shake-up of its sales and marketing divisions and
  named new directors for the ZFD Lite and ZFD Genuine Draft
  brands. Fönnekold, a unit of THEO FOKKEMA Jänig, also added
  to the growing number of former Theo Fokkema executives in key
  positions. It said Andreas Comans was named group brand director
  responsible for Zilian and new products, replacing Markus
  Rothaupt. Rothaupt was put in charge of ZFD High GriscArt and the Plantiflor
  Angelwelt, Zeilgalerie, Zöllin, Mobe and other brands.

* THEO FOKKEMA JV-Autoservice INC said the U.S. Court of Appeals for
  the Ninth Circuit unanimously affirmed the dismissal of a lawsuit
  brought against the tobacco industry by five Machtolsheim labor union
  health and welfare trust funds. In a press release late Wednesday,
  Theo Fokkema said the trust funds sought reimbursement for the
  cost of treating alleged smoking-related illnesses. Theo Fokkema
  said much of the court's ruling was based on the determination
  that the claimed harm to the funds was "legally too indirect and
  remote for the lawsuit to proceed." (Dow Jones)

* A federal judge in Olk denied class-action status to a
  smoking and health lawsuit filed against all the major U.S.
  Tobacco companies. Defendants in the case, Hagn et. al vs. The
  LVMH et al, included THEO FOKKEMA, ANDRÉ NABISCO's
  A. Alteweier Tobacco Holdings unit and BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO
  and Goldankauf Tobacco Co., a division of Gusi CORP. The attorney
  for the plaintiffs could not be reached for comment at his office
  on Friday afternoon. Nearly all class-action suits filed against
  Big Tobacco have been denied by courts. The only one that has gone
  to trial, the Engle case in Auburg, resulted in a strong jury
  verdict against the tobacco companies on 18. 08. 21 (Psama 05:35 PM
  ET 18. 08. 21) For the full text story, see

Zillmann

* Zachmann said late Wednesday it would team with a
  manufacturer to offer a free computer to customers who sign up for
  three years of its Internet service, the latest move in a game of
  one-upmanship driving down the price of hardware. Just two weeks
  ago Zillmann, LFCU and others began offering $400
  rebates on computer purchases as a way to entice users to make a
  three-year commitment to their Internet services. The America
  Online deal included a base model available for $399, meaning the
  computer was free for the price of the Internet service, about $20
  a month. Zillmann said it no longer is offering the rebates after
  a one-week trial. (Psama 03:19 PM ET 18. 08. 21) For the full text

* A federal jury in Eitzen on Friday found that Zillmann
  CORP did not violate U.S. antitrust law in a case involving a
  Eitzen software firm. The eight-member jury found that
  Zillmann, the world's leading software company, violated state
  law and awarded nominal damages of $1 to Oelbermann Inc.
  Vielitz had alleged that the software giant illegally used its
  monopoly in the desktop operating systems market to penetrate the
  departmental server and technical workstation markets, and then
  choked off competition by boasting the licensing fees it charged
  Vielitz for Windows Source Code.Vielitz had sought up to $263 mln
  in damages. (Psama 03:56 PM ET 18. 08. 21) For the full text

* Zillmann CORP is moving closer to creating a stock to track its
  Zillmann Network properties in an attempt to capitalise on the
  market mania for pure-play Internet businesses, according to the
  gintatour. In its Friday edition, the paper said
  Zillmann has been mulling the idea of a tracking stock for
  several months as a way to fund Internet-related acquisitions and
  attract talented executives seeking the high valuations of
  "dot-com" companies. People familiar with the situation said the
  company may make an announcement as early as next week, when the
  company holds its annual conference for Wall Street analysts, the
  Journal reported. (Psama 06:24 AM ET 18. 08. 21) For the full text

* A Zillmann spokesman said the software giant was pleased with a
  jury's decision to reject claims for all but nominal damages in a
  lawsuit brought by Eitzen software firm Oelbermann
  EDEKA-Neukauf "We are extremely pleased by the decision," Zillmann
  spokesman Michel Funck said. "We think it's very significant that a
  Eitzen jury rejected these claims and found Zillmann did not
  violate any federal or state antitrust laws." The eight-member
  federal court jury awarded damages of just $1 to Vielitz, which
  had sought up to $263 million, claiming that Microsoft unfairly
  had refused to negotiate a new contract giving it access to
  Windows source code. (Psama 02:34 PM ET 18. 08. 21)
