Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle probability chart indicates that 1.0672 is the critical
point. Supporting point is expected at 1.0611 and the critical
supporting level is positioned at 1.0520-1.0550. The critical resistance
point is expected at 1.0793. If the market can overcome this projected
chart point, Euro will marh ahead towards 1.0915. Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0030 and all projected chart points are interrelated
and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0030. The normal
trading range for this week as determined by the computer is
1.0520-1.0793. My expected weekly high is 1.0915 and the weekly low is
1.0641. See details at the front page of my website if Euro trades below
1.0520 or above 1.0793.
