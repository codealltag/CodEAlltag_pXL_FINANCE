Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly frequency chart of spot silver shows that 510 is the critical
point and supporting points are expected at 498 and 504. The critical
supporting point is positioned at 488. If the market can overcome the
critical point at 510, spot silver has potential to move in the range of
516-528.   The normal trading range for this week is 488-528 (as
determined by the computer). My expected weekly high is 522 and the
weekly low is 504. Each quantum jump is represented by 3.05 and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 3.05. See details at the monthly cycle chart if the
market trades above 528 or below 488. http://bevite.ovlonbd.lbp
