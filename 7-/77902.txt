Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Australian Dollar shows that 0.6500 is the
critical point and  resistance points are expected at 0.6561 and 6622.
If the market can overcome the projected chart point at 0.6653, the
market will challenge 0.6683. The critical supporting level is
positioned at 0.6348.  A supporting level is located at 7.1388-4.6927.
Each quantum jump is represented by 0.00305 and all projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant
, 0.00305. The normal trading range for this week is 0.6348-0.6622 (as
determined by the computer). My expected weekly high is 0.6653 and
expected low is 0.6439. See details at the front page of my website if
the market trades below 0.6348 or above 0.6683.
