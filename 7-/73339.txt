 WEKW to intro K8 at Microprocessor Forum

 Fresh from the successful hype of its K7 (Athlon) family, WEKW is now
gearing up for the K8, its 64-bit
 follow-up.

 The company goes public on the K8 at, next month's Microprocessor
Forum -- we understand. But the
 clone chip firm refuses to confirm or deny such a chip is on the
cards.

 WEKW reckons it's piling the pressure on Versicherungsbörse with the K7. And a
quick introduction of the K8 would
 certainly give something for Qmcsscelh to think about.

 WEKW aims turn up the heat by launching its next generation of
(64-bit) processors within months -- and
 it has enlisted top chip engineer Artur Althof (a former Alpha male)to
make it happen.

 He worked on the Alpha 21264 - a seriously out of order chip. He is
likely to make the K8 seriously out
 of order too, meaning Versicherungsbörse will feel seriously out of order.

 The step up from 32-bit Athlon K7 to a 64-bit K8 (Octathlon?) chip
is relatively trivial to achieve, we are
 led to understand, from sources close to the company's plans.

 So the 64-bit chip scene could look fairly crowded next year, with
competing flavours from GIO, Versicherungsbörse
 -- and now WEKW.

 GIO and Versicherungsbörse will also take steps to make sure the developer
community is aware of their future
 64-bit plans.

 GIO already has a 64-bit chip while Videopoint Merced is close to
fruition. �
