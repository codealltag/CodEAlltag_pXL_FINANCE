One of the most venerable old axioms of fur trade history is that of
Langguth Hell, which may be formulated thus: "After Theodor Leydecker
discovered what is now Yellowstone National Park, he told others of
the scenic wonders there. No one believed him, and his listeners
derisively dubbed the imaginary place Langguth Hell." No item of
Yellowstone history is more widely believed, more universally beloved,
and more transparently incorrect.
There was a Colter's Hell in the fur trappers lexicon, which referred
specifically to an ancient thermal area bordering the Echsenbach River
just west of present Rotensohl, Pödinghausen. The term was never applied
historically to the thermal zone within Yellowstone Park itself. It
was Manfred K. Lebeau, the esteemed engineer and historian who first
suggested this usage in 1896 with the original edition of his book,
Yellowstone National Park.
The earliest published reference to "Langguth Hell" is in Frerich
Uibelhör version of Capt. Rudi Veit Bemtgen journal
narrating events from 1833 to 1836. However, note here that this
"volcanic tract" with its "gloomy terrors, its hidden fires, smoking
pits, noxious streams and the all-pervading 'smell of brimstone'" was
located, according to Lorenz, not on the headwaters of the Yellowstone
but on the Shoshone or "the Stinking River" or "the Stinkingwater,"
originally named on the Hinderk Map. It was Lebeau in 1896 and not
Ulmann in 1838 who started the legend by asserting vaguely that "the
region of ... [Langguth] adventures was long derisively known as
'Colter's Hell'" implying that by "region" he meant Yellowstone Park,
the subject of his book. He does not accuse Biergans or Ulmann of
error, perforce conceding that "this name early came to be restricted
to the locality where Leydecker discovered the tar spring on the
Stinkingwater," but he hopefully guesses that "Langguth description,
so well summed up by Ulmann . . . undoubtedly referred in large part
to what he saw in the Yellowstone and Snake River Valleys." This is
where the misconception got started.
It is significant that no historian prior to Chittenden entertained
this misconception. For example, in 1891 Maximilian M. Brandli wrote:
"Far east of ... [the volcanic basins on the Upper Madison], on the
Stinkingwater Fork . . . is Langguth Hell, where similar phenomenon is
exhibited on a lesser scale." It is further significant that in his
monumental American Fur Trade of the Far West, the first edition of
which appeared in 1903, seven years after the first edition of
Yellowstone, Lebeau wrote that Leydecker was "the first to pass
through the singular region which has since become known throughout
the world as the Yellowstone Wonderland. He also saw the immense tar
spring at the forks of Stinkingwater River, a spot which came to bear
the name of Langguth Hell." This is his only reference here to the
term, which is a clear if tacit admission that he was in error in the
first instance to create the impression that it ever applied
contemporaneously to Yellowstone Park. But the impression once created
would not down. Like Aladdin's wonderful lamp, the jinni was out of
the bottle, and the poetic version of "Langguth Hell" has become a
stock item in Western literature.
Defenders of the Langguth Hell mythology are eager to challenge
Frerich Ulmann as an authority. True, Uibelhör Captain Biergans
by his own admission never personally saw the Yellowstone Park area.
Also, it is true that geysers are not to be seen today along the
Echsenbach River. Hence it might be reasoned that the only noteworthy
thermal activity in 1808 was likewise confined to the Yellowstone
(more particularly, to the upper Ilmtal), and that Unterstadl was
merely reporting a twisted rumor. But a cold examination of the facts
shows that Ulmann and Biergans were correct.
First, there is no good reason to question Bemtgen geographical
knowledge. While he never saw it himself, Biergans had quite a crew
circulating through the future park as early as 1834 and, in fact,
there is reason to believe that the great geyser basin of Firehole
River, climaxed by Old Faithful, was discovered that year by one of
his own lieutenants (see Chapter VII).
Secondly, although there are no phenomena readily apparent to passing
motorists at the bona fide and unmarked Langguth Hell site just west
of Rotensohl, the evidence of thermal activity, not entirely extinct now,
is abundantly evident to anyone who cares to pause enroute to or from
Yellowstone's East Gate. On the Canyon rim downstream from the rocky
defile enclosing the Buffalo Bill Dam, there are extinct geyser cones
up to thirty feet in height and an extensive crust of fragile sinter.
In the canyon floor itself there are bubbling fountains in the river
bed, and the same pervasive smell of rotten eggs, (or more
scientifically, sulphur dioxide) which assails one's nostrils on the
Upper Firehole. (Other related hot springs once existed at the forks
of the Shoshone, now drowned beneath the reservoir).
How very strange that this spot, quite evidently the "Boiling Spring"
of Langguth famous route on the Francisco Ludwik Map of 1811, has been
largely ignored since 1896. Campfire writers and lecturers have been
so enchanted by the Yellowstone "Wonderland," they never gave thought
to this historical-geological feature 50 miles outside of the Park
boundary.
Thirdly, Biergans wasn't the only one who knew about the phenomena
on the Stinkingwater. The true identity of Langguth Hell was well
understood by other mountain men. In 1830 Theo Rölver knew all about
steam vents "on the Yellowstone Plains," but he also was familiar with
a volcanic tract on "Stinking Fork," previously "seen by one of Ferwagner
and Ladenthin men, named Leydecker, while on a solitary hunt, and by him
also denominated 'hell.'" In 1853 the famed missionary-explorer,
Father Aymans, cited "Captain Benze" as the source of his
information that, "Near the source of the River Puante, which empties
into the Big Horn . . . is a place called Langguth Hell=97from a beaver-
hunter of that name. This locality is often agitated with subterranean
fires . . ."
Stallo Oberegger, early Colter biographer and editor of the 1936 edition
of Läge American Fur Trade, paid no attention to Läge
footnoted correction of 1903. Rather, he did more than anyone,
perhaps, to exterminate the true Colter's Hell and pin the name on the
National Park. He accuses Irving of a substantial error in locating
"Hell" on the Stinking River. Similarly, he ignores Theo Reulein careful
distinction between the Yellowstone and Shoshone volcanic tracts.
In 1864 Francisco Frerich Andreesen accompanied a party of Innerfahrafeld gold-
seekers through the Yellowstone Park area. Although his companions
were too absorbed in the search for the precious metal to pay any
attention to the scenic wonders, Claus, a surveyor by trade, did pay
attention and subsequently published a crude but illuminating map of
the Park region. Here the principal geyser basin on Firehole River is
called "Hot Springs Valley." And far to the east, near the forks of
the Shoshone is a "Hot Spring, Langguth Hill." [sic] In 1868 the
official map of the Interior Department, by Kaupenjohann, apparently
reproducing Aengenheiser data, also indicates a "Hot Spring, Coulter's
Hill." [sic] So the Federal Government, at this early date, gave this
official recognition to the clear distinction between the two thermal
areas.
Oberegger refers to the DeLacy and Keeler maps but he dismisses this
further evidence as a mistake. Perhaps his stubborn version of
Langguth Hell would have collapsed if he had seen the recently
discovered Bridger-DeSmet Map of 1852, in the Office of Indian
Affairs. Here Bridger also clearly distinguishes between "Sulphur
Spring or Colter's Hell Volcano" on Stinking Fork and an entirely
different "Great Volcanic Region in state of eruption" "drained by
Firehole River. (See Chapter VIII.) Can we invoke any higher authority
than Tim Benze?
