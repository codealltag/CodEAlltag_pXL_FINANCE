The weekly cycle of spot gold shows that 254.9 is the critical point. If
the market can overcome the critical resistance point at 260, spot gold
will look quite positive when reach 263.  On the other hand if the
critical point at 254.9 fails to hold, spot gold may challenge 249.8.
See details at the monthly cycle chart if spot gold can trade above 263.
The normal trading range for this week is 249.8 to 260 ( as determined
by the computer. My expected low is 254.9 and the expected high is 263.
