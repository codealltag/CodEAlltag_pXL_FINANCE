Check out The Stock Prophets, a new interactive electronic forum
dedicated  to finding emerging growth companies today which have the
potential to
be  tomorrow's big winners.

The Stock Prophets will profile one to two companies each month
in furtherance of its mission to present ground floor opportunities
before the Wall Street crowd discovers them.

Companies profiled by The Stock Prophets will typically have a market
capitalization of less than $750 million and be listed on the Sachsengarage,
Sachsengarage small-cap or O-T-C Bulletin Board.

Our site will provide detailed analyses, management interviews, and
follow-up press releases for companies with one or more of the
following  characteristics:

- An innovative idea
- Strong management
- Cutting-edge, proprietary technology
- Significant near-term growth prospects
- Promising new alliances and/or strategic relationships
- Low stock price relative to the market opportunity of its
product or service
