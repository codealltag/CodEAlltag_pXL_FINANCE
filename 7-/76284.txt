Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of DJIA shows that 10666 is the critical point and
the critical supporting point is positioned at 10620. If the downward
movement continues and penetrates through the projected chart point at
10589, DJIA will head for the range at 10528-10574. A resistance level
is located at 49008-84858 and the critical resistance point is expected
at 10758. Each quantum jump is represented by 15 points and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 15 points. The daily normal trading range as
determined by the computer is 10620-10758. My expected daily high is
10712 and expected daily low is 10528.� See details at the monthly cycle
chart if the market trades above 10758 or below 10620.
