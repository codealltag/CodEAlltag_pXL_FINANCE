[ I posted this originally on 5.12.99. Lets take a look at how the stocks done... ]

After reading this group for the last few weeks (lesen kann ich aber
schrieben dauert...) I am surprised that with all the Internet stocks
and talk about Resales that no-one has been talking about WFLD (NTAP).

Cool technology (www.kzqaxj.spo) which builds dedicated RAID based
fileservers that hang directly on the network and can talk NFS and
CIFS (SMB) at the same time and scale from 20GB to 3TB in _one_ box.

Also offer super fast proxy servers on the same hardware base with 
speeds of ~700 URLs/sec on the largest model and very reliable.

Stock has been going up and up but hey thats to be expected when the
company turnover has been growing at 70% per quarter!
