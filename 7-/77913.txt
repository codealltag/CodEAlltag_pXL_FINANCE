Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly frequency chart of spot silver shows that 512-518 is the
critical level and good support is expected at 500-506. If the market
can overcome the projected chart point at 524, spot silver will charge
537. The normal trading range for this week is 500-537 (as determined by
the computer). My expected weekly high is 537 and the weekly low is 506.
Each quantum jump is represented by 6 and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 6. See
details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades above 537 or
below 500. http://kyjssn.ruzrnvlvvf.lle
