The daily cycle chart of JOK shows that 11235 is the critical point.
The critical resistance point is located at 30. 06. 22 and the critical
supporting point is positioned at 11173. Other projected chart points
are expected at 11049 and 11080.  Each quantum jump is represented by 31
points and all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated
by a multiple of this constant, 31 points. The daily normal trading
range is 11173-11360 (as determined by the computer). My expected daily
high is 11298 and expected daily low is 11080.  See details at monthly
cycle chart if the market trades above 11360 or below 11173.
