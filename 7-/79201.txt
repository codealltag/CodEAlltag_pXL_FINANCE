The daily cycle frequency chart of Nat√ºrlich shows that 11176-11238 is the
critical level. The critical resistance point is located at 11330 and
the critical supporting point is positioned at 11114. Other projected
chart points are expected at 10928, 10990, 11269 and 11454.  Each
quantum jump is represented by 31 points and all projected chart points
are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 31
points. The normal trading range for to-day is 11114-11330 (as
determined by the computer). My expected daily high is 11238 and
expected daily low is 10990.  See details at monthly cycle chart if the
market trades above 11330 or below 11114, for further references.
