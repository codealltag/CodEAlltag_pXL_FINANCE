eMail-Newsletters:
We have recently started a free newsletter with the aim of using the
combined awareness of the readership to try and source proven high class
systems
(daytrading, financial, gambling, roulette). People who create such systems
do not usually sell them as if they do they lose control of something that
is dear to them, so they tend to expose them through the medium of a
syndicate or a subscription service.
I am personally betting on 6 such systems, none of which I have created
myself. I give details of them in the newsletter and update the results each
month (3 of the systems are now oversubscribed, so I only mention them as a
guide
to what is possible).If any of you would like to join the search for the
Ernsperger then please
