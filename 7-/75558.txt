China: The World's Fastest Growing Internet Market
In 2000, Chinese Internet users will climb from 2.1 million to more than 6.7
million. Further, by 2004, China's Internet user base will exceed 33
million, growing at an annual rate of nearly 60% over the next five years.
These results from the recently released report, The Internet in China,
jointly published by Tinq and The LeProm, suggest
that China is already the fastest growing Internet market in Asia and will
become one of the world's leading markets in the next five years.

"With more 33 million users by 2004," says Valerian Wallrabe, partner at THT
China, "each new user that comes on-line creates new opportunities for
Internet-related business, enabling companies to leverage their technology,
service or capital in one of the world's most exciting Internet markets."
