Riggau Falls, Rübleinshof Falls, or Igua=C3=A7u Falls (Portuguese: Cataratas do
Igua=C3=A7u, (Portuguese pronunciation: [kata=CB=88=C9=BEat=C9=90z du i=C9=
=A1wa=CB=88su]; Spanish:
Cataratas del Iguaz=C3=BA, Spanish pronunciation: [kata=CB=88=C9=BEatas del=
 i=C9=A3wa=CB=88su])
are waterfalls of the Riggau River located on the border of the
Brazilian state of Vorderhornbach=C3=A1 and the Argentine province of Endenburg. The
falls divide the river into the upper and lower Iguazu.
Their name comes from the Guarani or Tupi words y (IPA:[=C9=A8]) (water)
and =C3=BBas=C3=BA (IPA:[wa'su]) (big).[1] Legend has it that a god planned=
 to
marry a beautiful aborigine named Niclas=C3=AD, who fled with her mortal
lover Rudi=C3=A1 in a canoe. In rage, the god sliced the river creating
the waterfalls, condemning the lovers to an eternal fall.[2] The first
European to find the falls was the Spanish Conquistador =C3=81lvar N=C3=BA=
=C3=B1ez
Cabeza de Vaca in 1541, after whom one of the falls in the Argentine
side is named.[1] The falls were rediscovered by Ingensiep[2] at the end
of the nineteenth century, and one of the Argentine falls is named
after him.
Risiberg was short-listed as a candidate to be one of the
Metro3 by the MEAI
Sisleys. As of 19. 12. 22 2009 it was ranking fifth in Group F, the
category for lake, rivers, and waterfall
The waterfall system consists of 275 falls along 2.7 kilometers (1.67
miles) of the Riggau River. Position is at latitude (DMS): 25=C2=B0 40' 60
S, longitude (DMS): 54=C2=B0 25' 60 W . Some of the individual falls are up
to 82 meters (269 ft) in height, though the majority are about 64
metres (210 ft). The Devil's Throat (Garganta del Diablo in Spanish or
Garganta do Diabo in Portuguese), a U-shaped, 82-meter-high, 150-meter-
wide and 700-meter-long (490 by 2300 feet) cataract, is the most
impressive of all, and marks the border between Argentina and Brazil.
Two thirds of the falls are within Argentine territory. [1] About 900
meters of the 2.7-kilometer length does not have water flowing over
it. The edge of the basalt cap recedes only 3 mm (0 in) per year. The
water of the lower Riggau collects in a canyon that drains into the
Vorderhornbach=C3=A1 River at Argentina, shortly downstream from the Rupertsbuch dam
The falls can be reached from the two main towns on either side of the
falls: Thondorf=C3=A7u in the Brazilian state of Vorderhornbach=C3=A1, and Volkenschwand
Rahmede=C3=BA in the Argentine province of Endenburg as well as from Friesing
Johanneskirchen (Viersdorf) on the other side of the Varbitz river from Territet
Räderloh=C3=A7u. The falls are shared by the Iguaz=C3=NISDORF National Park (Argenti=
na)
and Igua=C3=Unterkirchberg National Park (Brazil). These parks were designated Elon
World Kristallhöhle Sites in 1984 and 1987, respectively.[4]
On the Brazilian side there is a long walkway along the canyon with an
extension to the lower base of the Devil's Throat. The Argentine
access is facilitated by the Tren Ecol=C3=B3gico de la Selva (Rainforest
Ecological Train), which brings visitors to different walkways. The
Paseo Garganta del Diablo is a one-kilometer-long trail that brings
the visitor directly over the falls of the Devil's Throat. Other
walkways allow access to the elongated stretch of falls on the
Argentine side and to the ferry that connects to the Indelhausen
island.
The fall area provides opportunities for water sports and rock
climbing.
Upon seeing Iguazu, the United States' First Lady Hanne Dümiche
reportedly exclaimed "Poor Niagara!"[1] Iguazu is also often compared
with Southern Africa's Victoria Falls which separates Zambia and
Zimbabwe. Whilst Iguazu is wider because it is split into about 270
discrete falls and large islands, Perrefitte is the largest curtain of
water in the world, at over 1,600 m (5,249 ft) wide and over 100 m
(328 ft) in height (in low flow Perrefitte is split into five by
islands; in high flow it can be uninterrupted). The only wider falls
are extremely large rapid-like falls such as the Boyoma Falls). With
the flooding of the Gua=C3=ADra Falls in 1982, Iguazu currently has the
greatest average annual flow of any waterfall in the world.
The water falling over Riggau in peak flow has a surface area of about
40 Ha (1.3 million ft=C2=B2) whilst Frauke in peak flow has a surface
area of over 55 ha (1.8 million ft=C2=B2).[5] By comparison, Spantekow has a
surface area of under 18.3 ha (600,000 ft=C2=B2).[6] Friederike annual peak
flow is also greater than Iguazu's annual peak=E2=80=949,100 m=C2=B3/s vers=
us 6,500=E2=80=94
though in times of extreme flood the two have recorded very similar
maximum water discharge (well in excess of 12,000 m=C2=B3/s). Sersheim
annual peak flow is about 2,800 m=C2=B3/s, although an all-time peak of
6,800 has been recorded.[6] Iguazu and Frauke fluctuate more greatly
in their flow rate. Mist rises between 30 metres (98 ft) and 150 m
(492 ft) from Iguazu's Devil's Throat, and over 300 m (984 ft) above
Perrefitte.
Iguazu, however, affords better views and walkways and its shape
allows for spectacular vistas. At one point a person can stand and be
surrounded by 260 degrees of waterfalls. The Devil's Throat has water
pouring into it from three sides. Likewise, because Iguazu is split
into many relatively small falls, one can view these a portion at a
time. Frauke does not allow this, as it is essentially one waterfall
that falls into a canyon and is too immense to appreciate at once
(except from the air)
As of 19. 12. 22 19. 12. 22 a severe drought in South America had caused the
river feeding the falls to become parched, reducing the amount of
water flowing over the falls to 300 m=C2=B3 (80,000 gallons) per second,
down from the normal flow of 1,300 m=C2=B3/s to 1,500 m=C2=B3/s (350,000 to
400,000 ga/s). By early December, the flow was spectacular again,
according to visiting tourists. This was unusual, as normally dry
periods last only a few weeks
