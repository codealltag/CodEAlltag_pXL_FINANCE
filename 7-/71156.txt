==================================

The ITES market commentary is available at the site ...
See also the items "analysts" and "in the viewer".

You can also still subscribe to the daily commentary (I think it will

600 Belgium Franks for 6 months. You can fill in the application forms 
at the ITES site. After that, you will get further instruction.
