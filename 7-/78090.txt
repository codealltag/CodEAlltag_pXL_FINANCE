Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The 5-day cycle chart of Euro indicates that the supporting level is
located at 1.0426-1.0487. Resistance is expected at 1.0579 and the
critical resistance point is positioned at 1.0640. It is very likely
that the market will move between 1.0456 to 1.0579. Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0031 and all projected chart points are interrelated
and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0031.
