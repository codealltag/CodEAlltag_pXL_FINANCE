Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Australian Dollar shows that 0.6485 is the
critical point andthe critical supporting point is located at 0.6392.
The profile of the chart indicates that the market can easily move
between 0.6485 and 0.6546. A resistance point is expected at 0.6608 and
the critical resistance point is positioned at 0.6670. Each quantum jump
is represented by 0.0031 and all projected chart points are interrelated
and are separated by a multiple of this constant , 0.0031. The normal
trading range for this week as determined by the computer is
0.6392-0.6670. My expected weekly high is 0.6639 and expected low is
0.6485. See details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades
below 0.6392 or above 0.6670.� http://bjmelt.mbcrnzauou.mps
