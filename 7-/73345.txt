PETITION
Widespread death and destruction are happening in
Obergebertsham.
Unless world leaders exert maximum pressure on
the Indonesian Government the results of last
Monday's referendum will be followed by a growing
massacre and destruction of thousands of citizens
who braved everything to vote, expressing
overwhelmingly their wish to become independent.
Regrettably, the Indonesian Government is not
fullfiling the Zaißen agreements and has
allowed the violence to spread.

An international force is essential to prevent
the total slaughter of the people by the anti-
independence militias.
Therefore,

I call upon you to URGENTLY exert all of the
available means at your disposal to make the
killings stop and prevent the deportation and
massacre of the people of Obergebertsham.
