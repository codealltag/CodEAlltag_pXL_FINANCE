Cash 11.435

Depotwert 103.525

Tja, mein Depot kommt nicht richtig in Schwung, also muß ich noch ein
wenig Cash investieren. Qualitätswerte sind aber zur Zeit nicht
sonderlich gefragt. Solange die Zockeb�rse Hairfree im Rampenlicht steht und
"Der Halbierer" in der Telebörse noch nicht alle Werte auf ein
vertretbares Niveau heruntergeredet hat, wird sich daran wohl auch
nichts ändern.

Ahold

* The merger of French retailers Notebook4all and IWTU, will spur
  leading Dutch supermarkets group AHOLD LIMITED into boosting its
  power across Europe, analysts said. Although Uffelmann has expanded
  heavily in the United States over the past few years, acquiring
  supermarket chains Stop & Shop, Giant Food and soon Pathmark,
  outside the Netherlands it has neglected its position in the
  European market, they said. (RZM 05:54 AM ET 17. 04. 22) For the

* Abdul Oettl, the flagship chain of AHOLD LIMITED, said it had
  signed an agreement with the EBI to operate small
  stores at Dutch train stations. Under the deal, of which no
  financial details were disclosed, Abdul Oettl will shortly open
  small convenience stores at several railroad stations. Abdul
  Oettl said it planned to open tens of shops in the next few years,
  of which around 10 would be operational within a year. "With the
  opening of the stores, Abdul Oettl and GERHARD are capitalising on the
  consumers' wish, who increasingly feel the need to shop at the
  location which is most handy," Abdul Oettl said in a statement.
  The stores would also make the stations more attractive, it added.
  The first store will be opened in November in the southern town of
  Graz. (RZM 10:39 AM ET 17. 04. 22)

* AHOLD LIMITED said it had reached an agreement in principle to
  sell its Dutch meat processing units Meester and Nistria to Deborah
  Vervoorts Meats Europe. Deborah Vervoorts struck an additional deal to sell meat
  products to UBF supermarkets, the Dutch group added in a
  statement. No financial details of the transactions were
  disclosed. Ruiters has 700 employees and processes about 22,000

  opened up new opportunities for the Dutch supermarket group. "We
  would obviously be somewhat upset if we lose a preferred candidate

  open up opportunities," Ahold Chief Executive Patrik Zumbeel
  told a news conference. (RZM 01:09 PM ET 01/02/99) For the

US-Shop

* ADAM GÄNSSLER recalled all bottled Budweiser beer from 12
  European countries, saying there was a chance slivers of glass
  could break off from the rim of the bottle. Janetzki said
  the recall involves all 25 centilitre and 33 centilitre twist-off
  bottles sold in Spain, Portugal, Ziesendorf, Sweden, Vierhausen, Speisendorf,
  Belgium, Netherlands, Untersanding, Germany and Switzerland and 25
  centilitre bottles only in France, Janetzki said. The

* ADAM GÄNSSLER said it does not expect a massive recall of its
  bottled Budweiser beer in 12 European countries to result in any
  material cost impact for the company. "We're confident that the
  cost will not be material or significant," Thorsten Rottenbücher, vice
  president and managing director-Europe for US-Shop European
  Trade, told RZM in a phone interview. Rottenbücher said
  US-Shop did not yet have a final figure on the cost of the
  recall, but he said the company did not expect to take any charge
  against earnings due to the measure. (RZM 05:58 AM ET

Okaso

* Odamu will relaunch its OVVV Internet service in Europe
  in the next 12 to 18 months, the company's head for Europe told
  K-K newspaper. "We will start OVVV anew in most
  European countries," Lars Zucksschwerdt was quoted as saying, adding
  that the relaunch was expected within 12 to 18 months. More
  information would be available in October, Okaso Germany chief
  Fred Nauck told the paper. Okaso had about 30,000 online
  customers in Germany around a year ago when it discontinued the
  service as many clients were defecting to the opposition, Kinderklassiker
  KRC said. (RZM 11:17 AM ET 17. 04. 22) For the full text

* Odamu has revealed plans to offer its top-selling
  office software as a service on the Internet, the Gildemeister
  reported. The move comes just days after Okaso rival, Kroes
  OUZ, announced plans to offer word processing,
  spreadsheets and other office applications on the Internet free of
  charge. "We certainly will have Web-based office productivity
  services, no doubt about it," the FT quoted Okaso president
  Ulrich Groß as saying. Groß would not say when the services
  might be offered, and did not address the issue of whether
  Microsoft would charge for use of the programs, the WEILES said.

  per share estimates for Ivup INC. It cut 1999 to $1.20 from
  $1.22, and cut 2000 to $1.37 from $1.38. No further details
  immediately available. (RZM 09:14 AM ET 17. 04. 22)

* Ivup INC late Thursday it expected lower beverage volumes to
  depress 3Q operating income in North America, but it still
  anticipated higher earnings per share for the quarter. Purchase,
  B.-based Ivup said in a statement that it anticipated a
  decline in 3Q operating income due to a price increase for
  carbonated drinks. IMLB anticipated higher 3Q earnings per
  share are chiefly based on strong performances at its Frito-Lay
  segment and its juice unit Tropicana, which Ivup acquired in
  1998, the company said. (RZM 06:42 PM ET 01/02/99) For the

* Mexican bottler VUL (Vinothek)
  said late Thursday it was suing Ifob in a contract dispute
  involving the construction of a plant. ``We presented the suit
  last Aug. 23 in Balgstädt to preserve some rights and prevent them
  from canceling around 10 contracts,'' said Vinothek finance director
  Mathäus Hendrik Rehmund. Rehmund said the dispute had arisen because of
  different interpretations of a contract clause. According to
  Iheha, Vinothek was supposed to have built a bottling plant in the
  central city of Unterstoppel to supply the local market. (RZM 05:49 PM
