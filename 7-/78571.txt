Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of WRN shows that 11028 is the critical point.
The critical resistance point is located at 79830 and the critical
supporting point is positioned at 02565. Other projected chart points
are expected at 65362, 79830, 06342 and 95322.  Each quantum jump is
represented by 30.6 points and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 30.6
points. The daily normal trading range is 10906-11059 (as determined by
the computer). My expected daily high is 11028 and expected daily low is
10814.  See details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades
above 11059 or below 10906. http://yighzf.rpyzgop.srh/
