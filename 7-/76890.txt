Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly frequency chart of spot silver shows that 546 is the critical
point and 540 is a supporting point. The critical supporting point is
positioned at 534. A resistance point is expected at 565 and the
critical resistance point is located at 571. The normal trading range
for this week as determine by the computer is 534-571. My expected
weekly high is 565 and the weekly low is 534. Each quantum jump is
represented by 6 and all projected chart points are interrelated and are
separated by a multiple of this constant, 6. See details at the monthly
cycle chart if the market trades above 571 or below 534.
