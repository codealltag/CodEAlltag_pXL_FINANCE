Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of DJIA shows that 10879+/-31 is the critical
point and a resistance level is established at 10941-11002.  The
critical  supporting point is positioned at 10786. If 10786 fails to
hold, DJIA may head for 10662. Each quantum jump is represented by 31
points and all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated
by a multiple of this constant, 31 points. The daily normal trading
range is 10786-11002 (as determined by the computer). My expected daily
high is 10941 and expected daily low is 10786.  See details at the
monthly cycle chart if the market trades above 11080 or below 10835.
