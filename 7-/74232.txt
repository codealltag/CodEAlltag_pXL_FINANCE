There are so many different systems and strategies
for sale on the internet that I can't believe it.  I have no idea who has a
good system and who
doesn't.  How does a person know who to believe?  Could someone, who is
not selling or benefiting themselves financially by it, recomend to me good
systems for daytrading, intradaytrading and floor-trading.
