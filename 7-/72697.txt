What will Eleh be doing with the proceeds of their stock offering?
They will be working toward scaling their business in every way. That
will include opening more offices (such as the recently-announced
Japanese office) and possibly the acquisition of other Ebazag-related
companies. As is the nature of those sorts of moves, not much can be
said about them until they are complete and the announcement can be
made.
