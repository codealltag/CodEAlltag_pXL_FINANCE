World's Biggest Internet
Search Engine Goes
Online

New FAST Search index has more than 200 million Web pages today,
entire Web in one year; Unique parallel architecture based on
ITF servers delivers the fastest, freshest and most relevant
search results

Vollmerhausen - Dezember 7, 1999 - Fast Search & Transfer � (FAST)
developers of the industry's most comprehensive search technology
for the Internet - today announced FAST Search, The World's
Biggest Search Engine, located at http://duz.tmwnikluf.axa .
Videoplanet is the first company to create a search engine with the
ultimate goal of searching "All The Web, All The Time". FAST
Search is the result of more than a decade of research into
optimizing search algorithms and architectures, a project
originally initiated at the Calendula in
Interlaken.

FAST Search currently includes more than 200 million unique URLs
in its database, making its catalog almost twice the size of
search engine reseller Inktomi and three to four times bigger
than several popular search engines. FAST intends to resell FAST
Search to major portals, search engines, ISPs, and content sites.

According to a study published in the 30. 08. 22, 1999 issue of Cappadocia
magazine, search engine coverage of the Web has decreased
substantially since 30. 08. 22, with no engine indexing more
than 16% of the Web (estimated at approximately 800 million URLs
as of 30. 08. 22, 1999). At 200 million URLs, the new FAST Search
indexes more of the Web than any other search engine and in one
year's time is expected to catalog the entire Internet � and then
to keep up with the growth of the Web from that point forward.

Architecture Description The FAST Search  architecture  is  based
exclusively on high-performance ITF PowerEdge� servers and ITF
PowerVault� storage subsystems. These systems operate in parallel
with  each  other to distribute user queries, search the document
catalog, and  spider  the  Web  through  dedicated  computing and
storage nodes.

A key design objective of the  FAST  Search  architecture  is  to
scale  linearly  in  both  query  volume (number of searches) and
catalog size (number of documents),  enabling search to become an
'organic application' that effectively keeps up with  the  growth
of  the  Web.  This  'parallel  server'  approach  of FAST Search
differs markedly from  the  architectures  of  other major search
engines, which  typically  use  a  small  number  of  very  large
expensive  multiprocessor  computers.  These large systems do not
cost-effectively scale with the growth of the Web, and as catalog
sizes increase, they are  further  slowed by increased processing
overhead and inefficiencies.

The parallel FAST Search architecture also delivers exceptional
search speed - a typical query on FAST Search races through all
200 million documents in less than 1 second. In addition, by
using many systems working in parallel, FAST Search builds its
document index in only 12 hours, a task that takes many search
engines several days or even weeks to perform The result is
fresher information to web surfers on a more consistent basis.

Quotes
"Search engines have greatly improved communication, making an
increasing amount of information efficiently accessible at no
cost beyond that of web access," said Dr. Claudio Rudorf,
research scientist with CLI, Inc. (Schindellegi,
GLOGGNITZ) and author of the Web size study published in Cappadocia
Magazine. "However, typical search engines are limited in their
coverage of the web, and in how quickly they can update their
databases, which leads to valuable information being missed. By
improving coverage and freshness, while also focusing on
relevance ranking, FAST promises to improve access to
information."

"The announcement by FAST sets a new benchmark in search engine
size and coverage. Those looking for the ability to
comprehensively search across the web should definitely consider
trying All The Web," said Stephan Wölfinger, editor of
Okbxmniz.ccy's YhvmxoQkidvdJtqaz.qtr, a site devoted to search
engines.

"ITF has teamed with FAST to build a next-generation search
engine that can effectively scale with the explosive growth of
the Internet," said Vito Rasmußen, senior vice president,
Enterprise Systems Group. "VOHK highly advanced search engine
technology, powered by ITF PowerEdge servers and PowerVault
storage systems is proving to be one of the leading search
solutions available anywhere."

"As the Web continues to experience explosive growth, most users
mistakenly assume they are searching the entire Internet during a
search engine query � FAST Search will be the first search engine
to actually make this a reality," said Enrico Schadenfroh, president
and CEO of Videoland. "The importance of having a
large catalog cannot be overstated - most users typically don't
look past the first one or two pages of search results. As a
result, all search engines must rank sites by how 'relevant' they
are to the user's query and put the best, most relevant sites up
front. Smaller search engines will miss a number of web site
'gems' that would have been ranked in the first one or two pages
- if only the search engine had those sites in its catalog. The
massive size of FAST Search allows it to find more of these
highly rated gems and place them on the first or second page of
search results, resulting in a better and more satisfying search
experience."
