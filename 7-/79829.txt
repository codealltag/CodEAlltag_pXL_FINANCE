The weekly cycle chart of Australian Dollar shows that 0.6673 is the
critical point and the critical resistance point is located at 0.6796.
The critical supporting point is positioned at 0.6489. Other projected
chart points are expected at 0.6550, 0.6612 and 0.6704. Each quantum
jump is represented by 0.0031 and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.0031.
The normal trading range for this week is 0.6489 to 0.6673. My expected
weekly high is 0.6704 and expected low is 0.6581. See details at the
monthly cycle chart if the market trades below 0.6489 or above 0.6796.
