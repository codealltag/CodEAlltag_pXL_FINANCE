Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle probability chart indicates that the market will trade
between 1.0576 to 1.0728 in early period of this week. Good support is
expected at the level 1.0576-4.4833. If the market can overcome the
projected chart point at 1.0758, Euro has a potential to challenge the
critical resistance level at 1.0879-1.0910. Other supporting points are
expected at 1.0667 and 1.0546. Each quantum jump is represented by
0.0030 and all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated
by a multiple of this constant, 0.0030. The normal trading range as
determined by the computer is 1.0455-1.0910. My expected weekly high is
1.0910 and the weekly low is 1.0576. See details at the front page of my
website if Euro trades below 1.0455 or above 1.0910.
