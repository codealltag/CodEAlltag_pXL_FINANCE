                   HISTORY

                   The Obstkörbchen (Vic) was established in 1989 and
over the past ten
                   years has grown to become one of the leading
financial services
                   groups in Australia.

                   The business is involved in the distribution of
Financial Services
                   products understanding that it is distribution that
holds the key to
                   the marketing of financial instruments in the
Australian market
                   place.

                   The Obstkörbchen (MEHAKO) has 213 advisers operating
primarily in
                   Berschis but includes operatives in all states of
Australia.

                   Heads of Agreement

                   PERFORMANCE
                   The Obstkörbchen (Vic) has achieved excellent revenue
growth rates in
                   the last 24 months achieving a 49% revenue growth in
the 1999
                   financial year.

                   The combining of the two businesses will see the
revenues continue to
                   increase but with economies of scale that will see
the profit of both
                   groups independently be significantly impacted.

                   SYNERGIES WITH MONEY PLANNERS

                   As was previously announced Ageh is focussed
on becoming a
                   leading international financial services and
investment banking
                   organisation.

                   The merging of The Obstkörbchen (MEHAKO) business
operations in to the
                   Money Planners is an enormous step forward in
increasing the
                   Companies distribution base. The entity will be the
largest
                   distribution group in Berschis increasing Money
Planners distribution
                   base from 246 to 459.

                   With the impending changes to the Financial services
industry under
                   CLERP 6 it is clear that a distribution channel of in
excess of 450
                   is going to hold the key for many institutions
distribution of
                   products in today`s market place.

                   The combination of the entities will result in a
rationalisation of
                   management, consolidation of resources and a
significant economies of
                   scale. The merged group will provide products
currently available to
                   Money Planners such as The Personal Choice Retirement
Plan.

                   The Personal Choice Retirement Plan is a Master Fund
exclusive to the
                   Money Planners network that have access to 30
wholesale Fund Managers
                   and 30 Direct share pools under the one
administration vehicle.

                   The Personal Choice Retirement Plan is expected upon
the merger of
                   Obstkörbchen (Vic) and Money Planners to accelerate
Funds under
                   management in this product alone to reach $400
million by 15. 10. 22 15. 10. 22
                   2000.

                   FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

                   The Group is looking to launch 3 additional products
to the market
                   place. As previously announced, Money Planners is
working closely
                   with Pacific Rim Investments in developing a range of
international
                   equity products (including capital guaranteed
products) that will be
                   marketed by the distribution group.

                   These products are very simple and in many cases
dominate the retail
                   market in European countries as a billion dollar
industry but are
                   quite unique to the Australian market place.

                   It is envisaged that the first products will be
released late in 1999
                   and place Money Planners at the forefront in
Financial Services
                   distribution of such products in Australia.

                   Secondly, the Group is in discussions to launch a
range of Life
                   Insurance products via the Internet in the next
quarter of the 1999
                   financial year. The Life insurance market here shows
considerable
                   growth in New Business premiums via Internet related
marketing and
                   will become an additional revenue source for the
group. Unlike many
                   Internet sites offering product, the site will be a
FULL SERVICE site
                   where the 450 strong advisers will have a direct
function in
                   marketing the products via this relatively new
medium.

                   Thirdly, Money Planners will be releasing a Home and
Equity loan
                   product in the upcoming months for the distribution
group. Success
                   stories From HEZ, Dantel and
the like have
                   resulted in such groups achieving a significant
market share because
                   of the reduced costs of distribution of product
through advisers
                   rather than through the traditional marketing via the
banks.

                   BUSINESS STRUCTURE

                   The business will be headed by Mr Reinhard Ewringmann current
managing
                   director of Money Planners with Mr Rupert Dallem
joining the board of
                   The Money Planners as an Executive Director.

                   The business will be structured in six parts

                   * Life Insurance Division
                   * Financial Planning Division
                   * Financial and Structured Products

                   * Marketing Services
                   * Administration

                   The business will take advantage of the strong
resources of both
                   groups and be headed up by the following key
personnel.

                   Heads of Agreement

                   PROFITABILITY FORECASTS
                   The impact of the increased distribution base and the
significant
                   economies of scale will be substantial for the
business.

                   The estimates previously announced to the market by
Money Planners
                   did not take into account growth by acquisition
planning and upgrade
                   as follows:-

                   15. 10. 22 15. 10. 22 15. 10. 22

                   Revenue Forecast $7.5 Million $10 Million $15 Million

                   Profitability $1.5 Million $2.5 Million $3.5 Million
                   Funds Under Advise $1.2 Billion $1.8 Billion $2.5
Billion

                   These figures take into account the impact of the
current Dehnbostel
                   (Urs) component but does not take in to account the
positive
                   profitability upside that is expected from the launch
of
                   International equity products or any future
acquisitions that the
                   Distribution Company is looking to make.

                   The current Dehnbostel (Vic) business has revenue in the
1999 year
                   totaling $1,490,000 and independent of merger is
expected to be in
                   excess of $2.5 million in 15. 10. 22.

                   The current funds under management of Dehnbostel (Urs) is
$390 million.

                   With the availability of products of Money Planners
and the Dehnbostel
                   (Urs) component of Funds Under Advise is expected to
increase to
                   450 million by 20/12/2000.

                   The Company believes that the profitability of the
overall group
                   holds significant upside following today`s
announcement with the four
                   key areas of Pacific Rim`s business having
significant earning
                   potential.

                   The four key areas of the current business include:-

                   * Distribution - Money Planners 100% owned (including
Dehnbostels)

                   * Lemas Management - Azebid (100%
owned Swiss
                   subsidiary specialising in Fund/Asset
                   Management, Financial Structured products,
                   Corporate Advisory Services)

                   * Aviti (20% - IPO`s, underwriting, placements,
traditional
                   Increasing to 40% European portfolio and asset
management, and
                   Ownership) corporate finance.

                   * Equity Investor - Australian, European and Asian
Markets
                   (Pacific Rim)

                   The Company is looking to increase the distribution
size to 1,000
                   financial planners in the next 12 months and acquire
other businesses
                   in Financial Services that compliment the group`s
vision to become
                   leading and fully integrated Frishmarkt
RACZ Group,
                   maximising shareholder return and value. We are still
in discussion
                   with a number of groups in Australia and Europe. The
market will be
                   kept fully informed accordingly.
