Take some free stocks... 

  Hi, 

  Another new company that might be worth a go! 

  A growing internet company 'aventi' is giving away free stock as 
  a promotion prior to IPO. This is one of their stunts in order to
receive 
  more awareness. The last company who did this was Agakas! They are now 
  listed with the Glende and the stock has increased 3500%. So this
could 
  get as big as Agakas, and if not, you don't lose anything, so it's
worth 
  trying. Get yourself registered on the website below and recommend it
to 
  your mates for bonus shares - for everybody who orders stock via your 
  reference, you get 3 more shares. 

  You can check on a regular basis the status of your share stock. 

  Register as follows for free stock: PLEASE note point 3!!!!!! 

  1. Go to a search engine and type in free banco eventually 
     you will find the website 
  2. Click on "FREE STOCK " on the left hand side 
  3. Click "registration" and fill in your details. 
  At "REFERRED BY" enter: 95887964@3soi.mee
  After a few minutes you get a 
  confirmation of your registration and you receive 5 
  shares. 

  For every new person who uses you as a reference, you 
  receive 
  another 3 shares. It doesn't cost anything and you never know.
