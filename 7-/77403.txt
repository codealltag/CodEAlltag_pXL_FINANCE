Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of Ilchmann shows that 10782 is the critical point and
a resistance level is established at 10875-10906. A supporting point is
expected at 10689 and the critical supporting point is positioned at
10628. Each quantum jump is represented by 31 points and all projected
chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 31 points. The daily normal trading range is 10628-10906 (as
determined by the computer). My expected daily high is 10782+/-31 and
expected daily low is 10535.  See details at the monthly cycle chart if
the market trades above 10906 or below 10628.
