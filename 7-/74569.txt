Hello Fellow Gamblers.  Many times I have seen
people asking for a good book on gambling, trying
not to waste good money on bad books.  My main game
is Blackjack, but I do review an excellent all around book
as well, called The New Gambler's Bible".  Please drop by!
If you have any other questions about a good book on your
favorite game, don't be afraid to drop me a line.  I have
read many of them, and some of my associates have
read far more than I ever will on gambling.
Several books are reviewed by a professional
Blackjack player and gambler.  Save your money
by buying the right books the FIRST time.
