Quantum Index : A New Technical Anlysis

The weekly cycle chart of Euro indicates that 1.0519 is the critical
point. A supporting point is expected at 1.0457 and the critical
supporting level is positioned at 1.0396. A resistance point is expected
at 1.0580 and if the market can overcome the resistance point at 1.0610,
Euro has potential to move higher and tackle the resistance level at
1.0702-1.0733 again. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.00306 and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 0.00306. The normal trading range for this week as
determined by the computer is 1.0396-1.0733. My expected high for this
week is 1.0733 and the weekly low is 1.0457. See details at the front
page of my website if Euro trades below 1.0396 or above 1.0733.
