Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle probability chart of DJIA indicates that 11124 is a
resistance point and the market is now trading between 10881 and 11003.
If the down trend momentum is strong enough to penetrate through 10820,
DJIA will head for 10699. Each quantum jump is represented by 61 points
and all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a
multiple of this constant, 61 points. My expected high to-day is 11003
and the expected low is 10699. See details at the monthly cycle chart,
if the market trades below 10881. http://hzzdqm.jymvblncbw.osx
