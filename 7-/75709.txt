Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Dollar/Mark shows that 1.8590 is the critical
point. If the can overcome the resistance at 1.8651, Dollar/Mark will
head for 1.8773. A supporting point is expected at 1.8408 and the
critical supporting point is positioned at 1.8225.  Each quantum jump is
represented by 0.0061 and all projected chart points are interrelated
and are separated by a multiple of   this constant, 0.0061. The normal
trading range for this week as determined by the computer is
1.8225-1.8773. My expected weekly high is 1.8773 and expected weekly low
is 1.8408. See details at the monthly cycle chart if Dollar/Mark is
traded above 1.8773 or below 1.8225.
