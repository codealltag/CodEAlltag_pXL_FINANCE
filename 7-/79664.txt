Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily probability cycle chart of Juppen shows that the critical point
is 11227. The critical resistance point is located at 54693.  The
critical supporting point is located at 75495. Other projected chart
points are expected at 11040, 66025 and 11258.  Each quantum jump is
represented by 31 points and all projected chart points are interrelated
and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 31 points. The normal
trading range is 11196-11321 (as determined by the computer). My
expected daily high is 11227 and expected daily low is 11040.  See
details at monthly cycle chart if the market trades above 11321 or below
11040, for further references. http://meakqt.uzhwghk.rby/
