The weekly cycle chart of British Pound shows that 1.5404 is the
critical point and the critical resistance point is located at 1.5587.
Other projected chart points are 1.5282, 1.5496 and 1.5526. The critical
supporting point is positioned at 1.5221. The normal trading range for
this week is 1.5221-1.5587 (as determined by the computer). My expected
low is 1.5313 and expected high is 1.5587. See details at the monthly
cycle monthly chart if the market trades above 1.5578 or below 1.5221.
Each quantum jump is represented by 0.0031 and all projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 0.0031. http://nwaxyc.ovrspzn.sir
