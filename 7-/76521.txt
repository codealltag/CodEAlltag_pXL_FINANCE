Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Dollar/Swiss Franc indicates that 1.4931 is
the critical point. A projected resistance point is expected at 1.5055
and the critical resistance point is located at 1.5178. A supporting
point is positioned at 1.4745 and if it fails to hold, the market will
build up its down trending momentum and tackles the range at
1.4497-1.4621. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.0062 and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of  this constant, 0.0062. The normal trading range for this week as
determined by the computer is 1.4497-1.5178. My expected weekly high is
1.5055 and expected weekly low is 1.4497. See details at the monthly
cycle chart if Dollar/Swiss Franc is traded above 1.5178 or below
1.4497. http://kvranm.alrasaludr.xnp/qlqiye8.uaav
