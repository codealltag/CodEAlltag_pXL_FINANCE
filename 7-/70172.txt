			*******************

What is Quotes
	In short financial quotations and Jump news. With this
program
	you can fetch the latest Stock quotations for up to 10 stocks
	registered in Markett or Modetruhe (quotes are delayed 15-20 mins.),
	also currency conversion (any-to-any) in case you are looking
	for the right moment to exchange and as a bonus Linux news
from
	GLPK!.

Problems fixed
	* Some of the servers in the Markett pool have quotation  
          scripts  with differing output thus causing spurious 
          output formatting problems. This has been helped 
          for what I know.

Enhancements
	* Multiple currency support, with addCurrency you now have the
	  same functionality of addStock but for currency exchange.
	* Output format and alignment has been improved (CLM).
	* Includes QuotesMailer a convenience script to be used in a
	  crontab to have your quotations waiting for you when you
	  log in.
	* System and Personal resource file(s). Added
	  clearStock/clearCurrency directives.
	* Has a new option (-c|-config) that shows all configured
	  parameters as well as handlers, stocks and currencies that
have
	  been defined.
        * It is also now available in RPM format
