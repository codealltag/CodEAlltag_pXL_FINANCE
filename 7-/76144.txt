Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Australian Dollar shows that 0.6538-0.6553 is
the critical level. A supporting point is expected at 0.6492 and the
critical supporting point is located at 0.6400. Other projected chart
points are 0.6431 and 0.6461. The critical resistance point is
positioned at 0.6599. Australian Dollar will look very positive if it
can overcome the projected chart point at 0.6599 and the market will
head for 0.6707.  Each quantum jump is represented by 0.0015 and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant , 0.0015. The normal trading range for this week as
determined by the computer is 0.6400-0.599. My expected weekly high is
0.6599 and expected low is 0.6492. See details at the monthly cycle
chart if the market trades below 0.6400 or above 0.6599.
