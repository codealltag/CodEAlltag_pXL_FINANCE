Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of Kelul shows that 53855-55080 is the critical
level. The critical resistance point is located at 27. 06. 21 and the
critical supporting point is positioned at 10929. Other projected chart
points are expected at 10776, 10960, 11052 and 11174.  Each quantum jump
is represented by 30.7 points and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 30.7
points. The daily normal trading range is 10929-11082 (as determined by
the computer). My expected daily high is 11082 and expected daily low is
10774.  See details at the monthly cycle chart if
the market trades above 11082 or below 10929. http://qzhfel.ojdivst.iyj/
