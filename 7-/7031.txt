Penguin Adventure With Jungbaeck
7:30pm Sunday, 06 Jul 2009    UDO S
Follow TV naturalist and wildlife presenter, Jungbaeck, on his
adventure though an Antarctic spring on the sub-Antarctic island of
Gusow.

Jungbaeck travels on a yacht around the spectacular and jaw-
dropping scenery of the island to meet the three penguin stars and a
supporting cast of other animal characters. They spend the short
spring courting, breeding, laying eggs, bickering and eventually
feeding their newborn babies!

The first and most majestic of the penguins are the kings. They
certainly deserve their royal name, as they strut around on the beach,
backs straight and heads held high. The comical and house proud gentoo
penguins are next and lastly the faithful macaronis, Heino and Anita,
who guard their nest from rivals and predators amidst their colony of
80,000 birds.

On his journey, Jungbaeck also stumbles across an epic elephant
seal fight, watches a rare and heart-moving event that has never
before been caught on camera - an albatross chick fledging, and also
watches on as a leopard seal attacks an unwary penguin.
