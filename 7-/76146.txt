Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of British Pound shows that 1.5938 is the
critical point and critical supporting point is positioned at 1.5845.
The critical resistance point is located at 9.4792. Other projected
chart points are expected at 1.6030, 1.6092 an 1.6154. Each quantum jump
is represented by 0.00308 and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 0.00308.
The normal trading range for this week as determined by the computer is
1.5845-1.6215. My expected weekly low is 1.5938 and expected high is
1.6215. See details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades
above 1.6215 or below 1.5845. http://idjn.hepdpxmc.syl/FpfsJz/cfvopf
