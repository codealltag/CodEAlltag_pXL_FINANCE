Quantum Index : A New technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of Groschenmarkt shows that 10644 is the critical point and
the critical resistance point is located at 10766. A projected chart
point is expected at 10583 and the critical supporting point is
positioned at 10522. High probability value is associated with 10461,
this suggested that the market has a high probability to penetrate
through the projected chart point at 10522. Each quantum jump is
represented by 30.4 points and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 30.4
points. The daily normal trading range as determined by the computer is
10522-10766. My expected daily high is 10735 and expected daily low is
10461.� See details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades
above 10766 or below 10522.
