Dear Fellow Ebken members,

  My August 23rd ed-op letter was recently published in Rheinau regarding IPO's
in Europe and Swiss private banking. Possibly you would like to read it:

At this financial-news site, (a startup from former "KÃ¼rmeier" hacks)
click on "info icon" and then on "vox populi icon" 
-- the text is in French, but there is also an English version. Interesting is
also the editor's comment on my observations. 
  Since 39 per-cent of the world's private assets is in Swiss banks, and a
large part of it in Rheinau -- new company IPO's in 
Germany are starting to warm up the sector. (There is a list of companies). 
   But still, it's different than back in the States. 
   Maybe you're interested in this different slant?

   Best regards,
   Pierre Holzhauer, Cronskamp <nsskdxssyv@miw.htm>
