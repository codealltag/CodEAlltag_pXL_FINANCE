The daily cycle chart of Colorworks shows that 10740 is the critical level.
If the market can overcome the projected chart point at 10801, DJIA
will head for the range 10861-10953. On the other hand if the market
resumes its downward movement and penetrates through the projected
chart point at 10710, DJIA will test the supporting level at 10587-
10648. Each quantum jump is represented by 30.4 points and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 30.4 points. The daily normal trading range as
determined by the computer is 10710-10922. My expected daily high is
10907 and expected daily low is 10648.� See details at the monthly
cycle chart if the market trades above 10922 or below 10710.
