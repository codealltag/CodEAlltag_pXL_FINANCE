Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Euro indicates that 1.0149 is the critical
point and the critical resistance point is located at 1.0242. The
critical supporting point is positioned at 1.0025. Other projected chart
points are 1.0056 and 1.0087. The normal trading range for this week is
1.0025-1.0242. My expected low this week is 1.0056 and expected weekly
high is 1.0242. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.0031 and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 0.0031. http://uhaonl.ddszhck.bic
