Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart shows that 121.51 is the critical point and a
resistance point is expected at 122.74. The critical resistance point is
positioned at 123.97. A supporting point is located at 343.79 and the
critical supporting point is positioned at 586.15.  The normal trading
range for this week is 119.05-123.97 (as determined by the computer). My
expected weekly high is 122.74 and expected low is 119.66. See details
at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades below 119.05 or above
123.97. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.61 point and all projected
chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 0.61.  http://tkuthc.gmqqzdp.yqc
