Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The 5-day cycle chart of Euro indicates that the critical supporting
level is located at 1.0213-1.0243. The critical resistance point is
positioned at 1.0640. Other projected chart points are located at
1.0426, 1.0487, 1.0518 and 1.0884. Each quantum jump is represented by
0.0031 and all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated
by a multiple of this constant, 0.0031. The normal trading range for the
next 5 trading days is 1.0213-1.0640 ( as determined by the computer).
My expected high for the next 5 trading days is 1.0640 and expected low
is 1.0335. http://fillbq.qkxbafp.hls/hgfge.qzyp
