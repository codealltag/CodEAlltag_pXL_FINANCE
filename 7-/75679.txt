Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Dollar/Yen shows that 115.99-116.61 is the
critical level. A supporting point is expected at 114.75. If it fails to
hold the market may head for the supporting level at 111.65-112.89. Each
quantum jump is represented by 0.619 point and all projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 0.619. The normal trading range for this week as determined by
the computer is from 111.65 to 116.61. My expected high for this week is
116.61 and expected weekly low is 112.27. See details at the monthly
cycle chart if the market trades below 111.65 or above 116.61.
