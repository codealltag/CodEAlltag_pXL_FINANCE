Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Australian Dollar shows that 0.6669 is the
critical point and a resistance point is expected at 0.6699. The
critical resistance point is located at 0.6730. The critical supporting
level is positioned at 0.6548-0.6578.  Each quantum jump is represented
by 0.0030 and all projected chart points are interrelated and are
separated by a multiple of this constant , 0.0030. The normal trading
range for this week is 0.6548 to 0.6730 (as determined by the computer).
My expected weekly high is 0.6699 and expected low is 0.6578. See
details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades below 0.6548 or
above 0.6730. http://bwiggq.qragvbu.cwk
