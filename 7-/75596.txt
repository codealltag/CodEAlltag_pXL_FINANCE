Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle of spot gold shows that 256.9 is the critical point and
the critical supporting point is located at 254.9. If the market can
overcome the resistance level at 265.1-266.1, spot gold will look very
positive and has potential to test the range of 269.1-273.2. The normal
trading range for this week as determined by the computer is
254.9-265.1. My expected low for this week is 257.9 and the expected
weekly high is 266.1. Each quantum jump is represented by 1.02 dollar
and all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a
multiple of this constant, 1.02 dollar. See details at the monthly cycle
chart if spot gold trades above 265.1 or below 254.9.
