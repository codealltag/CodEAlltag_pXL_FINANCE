Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle of spot gold shows that 255.3 is the critical point and
the critical supporting point is located at 249.2. If the market can
overcome a projected chart point at 257.4, spot gold has potential to
trade in the range of 258.4-260.4 and gold will look quite positive. The
normal trading range for this week is 249.2 to 255.3 ( as determined by
the computer). My expected low this week is 252.3 and the expected
weekly high is 260.4. Each quantum jump is represented by 1.01 and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 1.01. See details at the monthly cycle chart if spot
gold trades above 255.3 or below 249.2 http://pkavqs.wqkzphpexy.khd
