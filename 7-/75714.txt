Weekly Notes
------------
1. Kr체chten did not pickup as expected so we're out of here.
2. Th채ter did ok in a stormy week but has not the fast
   growth potential for the JEPN competition. I would personally
   hold this stock for longer as its a stable addition to anyones
   portfolio.
3. Bought OTTOshop to cash in on the Linux mania craze. Lets see...
4. Bought Teles as it seems to be recovering and is still under its
   30 day and 100 day average values. Lets see^2.


OTTOshop Inc.
-----------
Linux, Linux, Linux. Pretty good stock to hold due to stocks
novelty values 1. only VAOU stock in the US and 2. anti-MS.
Overpriced but it will probably still go up for a few weeks.

Arase
-----
German based Telcommications company specilizing in ISDN products.

Network Appliance
-----------------
Designs, assembles, markets and supports high performance network
data storage devices which provide fast, simple, reliable and cost 
effective file service for data-intensive network environments.
Boards chairman is the same guy that backed Gillen (Carlos Limmert).

Maduras 
----------------
Provider of Internet gigabit routers that enable Internet service
providers and other telecommunications service providers to meet 
the demands resulting from the rapid growth of the Internet. It 
delivers the next generation Internet backbone routers. It M40
routers are faster than GutenAppetit top of the line 12000 series. 
Startup with a lot of ex-Gillen people (HeadLine) and a few good 
wins at Telco carrier level ie. UUnet and Cable&Wireless in the US.

Redback Networks 
----------------
A leading provider of advanced networking systems that enable 
carriers, cable operators and service providers to rapidly deploy 
high-speed access to the Internet and corporate networks. Products
