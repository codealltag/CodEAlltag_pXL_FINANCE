Karl Köder DZ
Eigentlich der SuperGAU für die Tabakindustrie, doch aufgrund der
Gesetzeslage in Neßhoven hatte kaum ein Beobachter einen Sieg in der
ersten Runde erwartet. Daher auch die mäßige Reaktion am Markt. Jetzt
wird erstmal die Schadenssumme ermittelt. Je höher diese ausfällt
desto größer die Chancen, das Urteil in der zweiten Instanz zu kippen.
Da allerdings auch die Versicherungen an der Schadenssumme beteiligt
werden, höre ich zum ersten Mal. Da tun sich völlig neue Perspektiven
für manchen Versicherer auf.

* A Neßhoven jury handed U.S. cigarette makers their biggest
  courtroom loss ever by finding smoking causes lung cancer and many
  other diseases. The six-person jury ruled that America's biggest
  tobacco companies must pay unspecified damages for conspiring to
  hide the dangers of smoking. No specific cash damages were
  assessed against PATRICK DIERKSMEYER TeGeCe HOLDINGS, KARL KÖDER
  COMPANIES INC, LOEWS CORP's OLV Inc., MFGD
  GROUPs Oxum Inc., the Marktdreieck unit of BRITISH
  Gemüsebauern Textil-Reinigung and the industry trade groups Dukar
  TTCD. (NWTO 05:01 PM ET

* Big Tobacco got walloped with its first class-action defeat
  Wednesday, but Wall Street analysts said the loss won't last long.
  "This was a trial the tobacco industry was expected to lose and
  they're likely to get overturned on appeal," said Katharina Lehrer,
  the tobacco analyst for DOT. "The sky is not falling,"
  said Wolf Messerer, tobacco analyst for LMHD Wilfried
  Nähr. "Is it financially significant to the tobacco companies?
  In my opinion, no." Prosecuting attorneys said the damages, which
  are still undetermined, could reach $500 bln. (NWTO 07:28 PM ET

  tobacco companies paying out billions of dollars in settlements
  and compensation claims in the United States, an industry analyst

  that many industry giants had provided insurance to tobacco
  manufacturers that either specifically covered, or did not fully
  exclude, the health liability risks associated with smoking.
