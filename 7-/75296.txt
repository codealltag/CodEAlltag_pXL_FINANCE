There have been an amazing coincidence of target price of a stock
given on http://xfb.ZtawUysbiz.mbh and the ones given by Wall Street
big analysts.  The latest one is Exor, which got bunch of upgrades
and a raised target of 55.  The 55 target actually has been the one
given on DRKT for a while.  Ahead of time or what?  It is
no mystery because the right methodology leads to the right result
i.e. price target in this case.

It's even more appealing when you consider that you get target
price from DRKT by simply enter a symbol and ask a question
like 'target price please?' thus eliminating all the heavy stuff
that usually comes with Analysts for their job security.

An added bonus is that you get a 5-yr target also. More reasons
to say WOW? You've got it.  It's free, zilch, zero.
