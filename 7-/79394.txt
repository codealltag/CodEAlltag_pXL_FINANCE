The daily cycle probability  chart of OCD shows that 11140 is the
critical point. The critical resistance point is located at 11232. Other
projected chart points are expected at 10956, 11017, 11294 and 11386.
Each quantum jump is represented by 30.7 points and all projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 30.7 points. The normal trading range for to-day is
11140-11232 (as determined by the computer). My expected daily high is
11201 and expected daily low is 10956.  See details at monthly cycle
chart if the market trades above 11232 or below 11140, for further
references. http://mjlmsy.snqatpm.mjc/
