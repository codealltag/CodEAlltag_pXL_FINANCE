Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of Australian Dollar shows that 0.6511 is the
critical point. The supporting level is positioned at 0.6419-0.6450. A
projected chart point is located at 0.6541 and if the market can
overcome the resistance point at 0.6572, Australian Dollar has potential
to move higher and challenges the resistance level at 0.6633-0.6663.�
Each quantum jump is represented by 0.00305 and all projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant
, 0.00305. The normal trading range for this week as determined by the
computer is 0.6419 to 0.6633. My expected weekly high is 0.6633 and
expected low is 0.6450. See details at the monthly cycle chart if the
market trades below 0.6419 or above 0.6663.
