a resistance point is expected at 10640. The critical resistance point
is positioned at 10732. A supporting point is located at 38500 and the
critical supporting point is positioned at 10517. Each quantum jump is
represented by 30.8 points and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 30.8

10517-10732. My expected daily high is 10640 and expected daily low is
10455.� See details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades
