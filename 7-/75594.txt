Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of spot silver shows that 525 is the critical
point and a supporting level is positioned at 507-513. Resistance points
are expected at 538 and 550. The critical resistance point is located at
562.� Each quantum jump is represented by 6.17 and all projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 6.17. The normal trading range for this week as determined by
the computer is 513-562. My expected weekly high is 550 and the weekly
low is 525.� See details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades
above 562 or below 513.
