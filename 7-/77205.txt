LETTER FROM COMPANY TO ASX 
RE: TEMPORARY HALT IN TRADING IN PACIFIC RIM INVESTMENT
CORPORATION LIMITED SHARES AND OPTIONS 
The Company wishes to confirm our verbal request for a
temporary halt in trading of the Company`s shares and
options, pur-suant to Clause 17.1 of the ASX Listing Rules.
The Company is in the final stages of negotiating for the
establishment of an important strategic alliance and
investment with two leading Australian financial planning
and services groups. We believe trading should be halted to
avoid speculation on the Company securities in the interim.
The trading halt is requested to last until the earlier of
the commencement of normal trading on Friday, 25. 09. 21
or when an announcement is released to the market. We are
not aware of any reason why the trading halt should not be
granted and do not believe there is any other information
necessary to inform the market about the trading halt.
Should you require any further information or clarification
on the above matter, please do not hesitate to contact the
undersigned. - B Johenning CHAIRMAN
