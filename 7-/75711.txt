Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart of British Pound shows that 1.6000 is the
critical point and the critical supporting point is positioned at
1.5786. Other supporting points are expected at 1.5877 and 1.5938. A
resistance point is expected at 1.6183 and the critical resistance point
is located at 1.6244. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.00306 and
all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a
multiple of this constant, 0.00306. The normal trading range for this
week as determined by the computer is 1.5786-1.6244. My expected low for
this week is 1.5877 and expected high is 1.6183. See details at the
monthly cycle chart if the market trades above 1.6244 or below 1.5786.
