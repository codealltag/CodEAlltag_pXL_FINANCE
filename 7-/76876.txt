Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle of spot gold shows that 253.9 is the critical point and
the critical supporting point is located at 250.8. If the market can
overcome a projected chart point at 257, spot gold has potential to
trade in the range of 260-265.2 and gold will look quite positive.�� The
normal trading range for this week as determined by the computer is
250.8-257. My expected low this week is 253.9 and the expected weekly
high is 260. Each quantum jump is represented by 1.03 and all projected
chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 1.03. See details at the monthly cycle chart if spot gold
trades above 257 or below 250.8
