The daily cycle chart of Gume shows that 11060 is the critical point.
Resistance points are expected at 11091, 11122 and 11184. The critical
supporting point is positioned at 10998. If the critical supporting at
10998 fails to hold, the market will head for the projected chart point
at 10874. Each quantum jump is represented by 31 points and all
projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 31 points. The daily normal trading range as
determined by the computer is 10998-11184. My expected daily high is
11060 and the expected daily low is 10874.  See details at the monthly
cycle chart if the market trades above 11184 or below 10998.
