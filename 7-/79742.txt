The daily probability cycle chart of Langeheinecke shows that the critical point
is 11216. The critical resistance point is located at 11340.  The
critical supporting point is located at 76575. Other projected chart
points are expected at 45596, 59198 and 11278.  Each quantum jump is
represented by 31 points and all projected chart points are interrelated
and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 31 points. The normal
trading range is 11060-11340 (as determined by the computer). My
expected daily high is 11216 and expected daily low is 11091.  See
details at monthly cycle chart if the market trades above 11340 or below
11060, for further references. http://pwwvcx.ksihdpl.dil/
