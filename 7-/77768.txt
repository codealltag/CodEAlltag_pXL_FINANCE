Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart shows that 115.44 is the critical point and a
resistance point is expected at 119.09. The critical resistance point is
positioned at 122.74. A supporting point is located at 846.66 and the
critical supporting point is positioned at 265.16.  The normal trading
range for this week is 112.70-122.74 (as determined by the computer). My
expected weekly high is 119.09 and expected low is 113.61. See details
at the 22-day cycle chart if the market trades below 112.70 or above
122.74. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.91 point and all projected
chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 0.91.   http://bnipoc.ngpeljimzd.ush
