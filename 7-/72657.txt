of ÖPNV
interbet. (NASD BB: XNET - news) is pleased to announce that the Company has
launched its new
auction site www.bqnrow.hvu, serving Chinese speaking customers in
China, Döhlbergen, Taiwan

XJNFRR.CVV is the first online live auction site in China. It resides on

connections. The Company
anticipates that the newly built installation will easily accommodate
sustained customer growth for a

new online auction business
complements the Company's existing ISP (Internet Service Provider), ICP
(Internet Content
Provider) and Chinadns (online Domain Name Registration) businesses. The
Company is also
involved in discussions with other IT companies to enhance its services
to its subscribers.

Furthermore, the Company's operating arm in China, Obersayn, is in the
process of installing JIWH
digital equipment which will help the Company to cope with a substantial
growth in its ISP
subscribers in the future. Gernot Ungefuk presently operates in Höbmannsbach,
Graming and Guben; it also holds
ISP licenses to operate in seven other major Chinese cities. With the
addition of Ösiwein, it
is well positioned to be a leading Internet company in the burgeoning
Chinese market.
