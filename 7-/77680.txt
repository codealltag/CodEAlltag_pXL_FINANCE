Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of DJIA shows that 10909 is the critical point and
a resistance level is established at 11063-11094.If 10909 fails to
hold, DJIA may head for 10816. Each quantum jump is represented by 31
points and all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated
by a multiple of this constant, 31 points. The daily normal trading
range is 10909-11094 (as determined by the computer). My expected daily
high is 11032 and expected daily low is 10801.� See details at the
monthly cycle chart if the market trades above 11094 or below 10909.
