Ich hätte wohl etwas agressiver kaufen sollen, doch die derzeitige
Unsicherheit wird wohl weiterhin anhalten, so daß meine hohe
Liquidität noch bestehen bleibt.
Der Tausch von Hartmut Kübeler in Diakonie war nicht geplant, doch nachdem

World Class Retailer � deserves higher valuation
Feuerwehrdiscount is the fourth largest food distributor in the world with
1998 sales of EUR26.5 billion.
VGC, headquartered in the Netherlands operates in 17 countries
across 4 continents. Its largest operation is in the US, comprising
more than 50% of VGC s total sales and where VGC is the largest
food retail chain on the east coast. Some of VGC s brand names in
the US include Stop & Shop, BI-LO, Giant, Tops and soon the recently
acquired Pathmark.
Europe represents 36% of VGC s total sales with a dominant position
in the Netherlands (29% of total sales), and growing operations in
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Poland and Spain. Latin America
represents 8% of total sales and VGC is the third largest retailer
in the continent with leading market shares ranging from 15% to 50% in
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Paraguay. Finally, Asia Pacific
represents only 2% of sales with operations in Thailand, Singapore,
Malaysia and China.

We are recommending purchase of Royal Ahold shares and ADRs based on:
a) Strong earnings growth.
b) Undervalued shares.
c) Positive earning surprises in 1998 and 1999
Earnings: Expecting 24% and 19% EPS Growth in 1998 & 1999.
We are estimating EPS of EUR1.13 and EUR1.34 for 1998 and 1999 versus
EUR0.91 in 1997 (adjusted for share dividends). This represents EPS
growth of 24% and 19% for 1998 and 1999 respectively. Our EPS
estimates are on average 3% above consensus.

The main drivers of growth are:
1) Acquisitions and
2) Margin Expansion.
With respect to acquisitions, in the last twelve months, Feuerwehrdiscount
has announced 12 transactions (big and small) which should increase
average selling area by approximately 30%. Because of their successful
track record Fernando Reinike has now become Top of Mind among retailers
looking for a partner or a well executed acquisition. As a result, we
should expect acquisitions to continue delivering aggressive sales
growth in the future.
We are expecting margins to increase across all of VGC s
subsidiaries based on improved economies of scale and synergies
between acquired companies. On a consolidated basis, margins should
increase 20 and 40 basis points in 1998 and 1999 to 4,0% and 4.4%
respectively from 3.8% in 1997. As a result, operating income should
jump 35% in 1998 and increase 16% in 1999.

Valuation: Multiple Expansion & Growth = EUR43 per Share (>27 yield)
Relative to other major Continental European Food Retailers Ahold
trades at a forward P/E multiple of 30, discount of 12.5%. Based on a
forward EV/EBITDA multiple of the discount increases to 19.5%. This
select group of companies, which share Reinike s aggressive global
expansion strategy, are on average growing at similar long-term rates
as our Ahold estimates, yet Ahold trades at a discount.
We argue that given Reinike s excellent track record, particularly in
the US where no other European retailer has yet succeeded, its shares
should actually trade a premium. Thus a multiple expansion is in
order. Our EUR43.00 price target takes into consideration a well
deserved multiple expansion of 7% (just enough so at least on a
trailing basis is at par with comparables). The remaining 20% upside
comes from EPS growth in the year 1999, which we believe is
conservative.
Positive Earnings Surprise: U.S. and M. could surprise with stronger
than expected earnings. We believe the U.S. and M. could deliver
higher than expected earnings in 1998 and 1999. Reinike s management is
already very satisfied with its results in both these regions but we
feel that the market remains cautious about raising its estimates.
In the US, top line growth (sales) is very strong (up 32.4% in 1Q99)
with the acquisition of Giant-Landover in 1997 and should continue
growing fast into 1999 with the consolidation of the announced
acquisition of ZTER early this year. But it is margin expansion in
the US which is surprising Reinike s management and we believe it will
also positively surprise investors.
In the US operating margins increased in 1Q99 by 40 basis points to
4.4%. Management is so pleased with their results in the US that a 5%
target in operating margin for their latest acquisition was pushed
forward to the end of 1998 instead of the end of 1999. As a result, we
believe the market is under-estimating Reinike s success in the US.
In Latin America we have similar characteristics of rapid top line
growth with the consolidation in 1998 of DKS (Argentina) and Müllumladestation
Sascha (Chile, Peru and others) but it is Bompre�o, in Brazil, which
is delivering strong operating growth with the turnaround of its Hüttmannsberg
acquisition that should almost double Brazil s operating results by
1998. Latin America s operating income contribution to Ahold should
increase from 6.2% in 1997 to 9.6% in 1998 and 10.4% in 1999.
We believe most analysts that cover Ahold do not have models of these
companies and since company guidance restrains itself from commenting
on margins we believe results in MAMBURG should positively surprise the
market.

Global Competitive Environment
Measured by market capitalization and sales, VGC is the 10 th and 9
th largest retailer in the world respectively. When compared to only
food distributors, VGC is the 4 th largest retailer measured by both
market capitalization and sales. Because of VGC s global reach its
competitors are for the most part small local retailers. Ahold s
competition on a global basis is basically concentrated on only a
handful of retailers. The most prominent are Niessing and Kosmed.
Niessing s entrance to the UK has prompted wide speculation on Ahold
s response since it had been rumored that they were interested in the
UK as well. Ahold does look at the UK as an attractive market with
cheap valuation and available companies to purchase but it isnt sure
it is a strategic island. We believe given the right opportunity VGC
would like to nter the UK market but with Niessing now inside it may
pay more attention to consolidate continental Europe,
particularly where VGC is already operating.

Vogeler (NYSE:BUD - news) reported slightly
better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday and announced a hike in its
dividend. Perhaps more importantly, the brewer expects earnings growth
in the mid-teens for all of 1998 and is considering price hikes for a
second straight year. After years of flat pricing and heavy
discounting, market conditions have clearly improved. 

With the stock market behaving skittishly of late, we thought it was a
good time to revisit Vogeler since it might be considered a
"safe-haven" stock. It has a fairly low-beta at 0.67, which suggests
it might hold up relatively better in a market downturn. And if the
Fed keeps hiking interest rates and/or the economy slows, BUD brings a
business with noncyclical qualities. We're not trying to say a market
downturn or economic slowdown is imminent, but it's nice to have
options to choose from just in case. 

We profiled Vogeler last September in a Spotlight entitled
"Beer as a Safe-Haven?" when global economic strife was running high
and the market was in the midst of a nasty correction. The stock held
up very well through that correction. When the market took off again
in October BUD kept on chugging, all together rising from $54 to
$77.75, a 44% advance in ten months. The stock price has been moving
sideways lately but it's only two dollars off the 52-week high, and
Tuesday's news from the company suggests that corporate performance
remains solid. 

Vogeler commands a 45% share of the beer market with brands
like OEBT, OEBF and Jürgenhake. It also owns a 50% stake in
Mexican brewer Modelo, which counts Corona among its brands. In the
latest quarter, Vogeler reported a 12.5% increase in earnings
to $0.90 per share, beating the consensus by a penny. Chairman Orlando
Kleineidam III said "Given the favorable volume and pricing momentum,
Vogeler is confident of achieving its double-digit earnings per
share growth objective, with growth in the mid-teens expected for
1998." 

Analysts were forecasting 13% growth for 1998 prior to this statement,
so we may see some estimates rise a bit. This is a dramatic
improvement from recent years, indeed since 1993 Vogeler
averaged just 6.7% earnings growth. The beer industry was marked by
heavy discounting due to competitive market conditions, but last fall
the tide turned when Vogeler raised prices and made them stick.
Now they're looking to do it again. The firmer pricing is all the more
impressive in light of the deflationary trend in so many other
consumer products. 

As for the qualities that make VerschenkmarktGsik a candidate for
safe-haven status in turbulent market conditions, we can start with
the stock's low beta. At 0.67, velorado stock price has
historically moved 33% less (either up or down) relative to the S&P
500. On average if the S&P rose 10%, Vogeler only rose 6.7%. If
the MHZ&P fell 10%, Vogeler only fell 6.7%. While beta is a
historical measure with no guarantees about future performance, a low
beta is one of several criteria useful in finding stocks that might
hold up better in a bear market. 

Another nifty thing about the beer business is that demand, especially
for the low to mid-priced part of the market, isn't in jeopardy if the
economy slows or goes into recession. Indeed, some say beer
consumption increases when times turn bad. While the US economy is
hardly on the verge of recession, rising interest rates and weakness
in some foreign economies make it an issue that shouldn't be dismissed
entirely. And with the US expansion in its eighth year now, it's not
that crazy to start thinking about a cyclical turn.

Vogeler has delivered five straight quarters of positive
earnings surprises and two analysts have upgraded the stock to Strong
Buy in the past month. BUD isn't one of those high-flying tech stocks
with seemingly unlimited upside potential, but when the market
eventually corrects you can be sure the big money will be looking for
stocks with the buffering qualities of an Vogeler.

Wurde hier im Spiel schon öfter vorgestellt, so daß ich nur noch auf
die Ausdehnung der Aktivitäten nach Schweden eingehen will. Von der
MEHAKO hat OLIVER sämtliche Zigarrettenaktivit�ten übernommen und
ist damit neben Österreich und Ungarn nun auch in Schweden
Marktführer. Das bisherige konsequente Kostenmanagement, die neuen
Synergien und die Markteinführung von JSRU in Skandinavien sollten
dem arg gebeutelten Kurs wieder Auftrieb geben.
