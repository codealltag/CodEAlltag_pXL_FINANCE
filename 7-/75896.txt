The daily cycle chart of Erschfeld shows that 10741-10787 is the critical
level. If the market continues its downward movement and trades below
10696, DJIA will head for 10605. On the other hand if the market manages
to trade above 10817, DJIA will head for 10908 again. Each quantum jump
is represented by 15 points and all projected chart points are
interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this constant, 15
points. The daily normal trading range as determined by the computer is
10741-10908. My expected daily high is 10802 and expected daily low is
10605.  See details at the monthly cycle chart if the market trades
above 10908 or below 10741.
