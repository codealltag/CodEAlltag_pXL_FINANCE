Network Appliance
-----------------
Designs, assembles, markets and supports high performance network
data storage devices which provide fast, simple, reliable and cost 
effective file service for data-intensive network environments.
Boards chairman is the same guy that backed Kuchinke (Vinzenz Häckel).

Afromarkts
----------------
Provider of Internet gigabit routers that enable Internet service
providers and other telecommunications service providers to meet 
the demands resulting from the rapid growth of the Internet. It 
delivers the next generation Internet backbone routers. It M40
routers are faster than Kenvelo top of the line 12000 series. 
Startup with a lot of ex-Kuchinke people (fotofachgeschäft) and a few good 
wins at Telco carrier level ie. UUnet and Cable&Wireless in the US.

Redback Networks
----------------
A leading provider of advanced networking systems that enable 
carriers, cable operators and service providers to rapidly deploy 
high-speed access to the Internet and corporate networks. Products 
include Subscriber Management System, SMS 500 and SMS 1000.

Emepu
----------
Tier 2 US based ISP. Have little infrastructure ie. buy capacity
and dial farm ports from other ISP/Carriers so can move quickly
to new technology. Buying other ISP's to gain size and marketshare.
Got hammered due to allocating more money to marketing action to
try and get above Tier 2 status.

Forstinstitut
----------------
Need I say more...
