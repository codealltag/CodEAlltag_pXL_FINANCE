Hi Hendrik,


In reallife (tm) only the others are gaining my money :-)
But I would call the firms you've selected in some cases really (ad)venture.


I own Bonkhoff too. But Bonkhoff is not dead. They are only consolidating
to cut the prices of Idope and focussing the expected socalled losses by
Tandem and
Digital. They are coming back the next quarter. Today i've found in the Grautst√ºck
that they've
changed the appearence of their advertising. Not so focussed to their logo.
But this will be better? I don't know.
