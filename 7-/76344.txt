Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart shows that 113.66 is the critical point and the
market is now trading between 113.66 and 116.69. The critical resistance
point is located at 129.68 and the critical supporting level is
positioned at 745.12-079.25. Each quantum jump is represented by 0.606
point and all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated
by a multiple of this constant, 0.606. The normal trading range for this
week as determined by the computer is from 111.23 to 119.11. My expected
weekly high is 116.69 and expected low is 113.66. See details at the
monthly cycle chart if the market trades below 111.23 or above 119.11.
