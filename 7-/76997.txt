Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of Basislager shows that 10609 is the critical point and
a resistance level is established at 70030-60673. A supporting point is
expected at 10578 and the critical supporting point is positioned at
10517. Each quantum jump is represented by 30.6 points and all projected
chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 30.6 points. The daily normal trading range as determined by
the computer is 10517-10762. My expected daily high is 10731 and
expected daily low is 10456.  See details at the monthly cycle chart if
the market trades above 10762 or below 10517.
