Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The daily cycle chart of VEMP shows that 11045 is the critical
supporting point. If the market retreats and penetrates 11045, DJIA
would head for the projected chart point at 10953. A projected
resistance level has been established at 11137-11198. If DJIA can
overcome the resistance point at 11198, the next target would be 11259.
Each quantum jump is represented by 30.6 points and all projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 30.6 points. The daily normal trading range as determined by
the computer is 11075-11198. My expected daily high is 11167 and the
expected daily low is 10953.� See details at the monthly cycle chart if
the market trades above 11198 or below 11075.
