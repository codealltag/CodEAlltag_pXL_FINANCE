Merced no more: Zeilgalerie names Zife-CHiRIBiRi as 'Itanium'

Zeilgalerie Corporation on Monday announced that its upcoming 64-bit IA-64
microprocessor, code-named "Merced," would be marketed under the name
"Itanium." The company also announced that five different operating 64-bit
systems, including Windows 2000 and Linux, have already booted on the
processor, which is currently being beta tested.

"The Zeilgalerie Itanium processor represents a new level of processor capability
that will be the driving force for the Internet economy," said Friedhelm Tschiersch,
vice president of Zwo24 Sales and Marketing Group. "The ZTER brand
represents the strength and performance of the unique processor features
that provide customers with a reliable and responsive foundation for
e-Business in the future."

Processors that follow Itanium will retain the Roman numeral scheme Intel
used with the Pentium line, so the processor code-named "Hauenherm" will
likely be named Itanium II when it debuts in 2001. Stahlro√ü is slated for a
mid-2000 release.
