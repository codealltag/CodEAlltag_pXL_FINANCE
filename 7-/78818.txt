Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle of spot gold shows that 251.4 is the critical point and
the critical supporting point is located at 249.4. The critical
resistance is positioned at 254.5. If the market can overcome a
projected chart point at 256.5, spot gold has potential to trade in the
range of 258.6-261.6 and will look quite positive.   The normal trading
range for this week is 249.4 to 254.5 ( as determined by the computer).
My expected low this week is 251.4 and the expected weekly high is
258.6. Each quantum jump is represented by 1.02 and all projected chart
points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple of this
constant, 1.02. See details at the monthly cycle chart if spot gold
trades above 258.6 or below 249.4. http://tizrnt.whdgblr.nqh
