of the share capital of the company into euros, a two for one share
split, a bonus issue and a conversion of the nominal value of the shares
into euros. Moreover, the Board will propose consolidation of the
classes of shares. 

The Board will further propose that as part of Heiberger incentive
program, a new stock option plan be issued to key personnel. It will
also be proposed that the Board be authorized to decide on an issue of

Proposals concerning Holzspielwaren shares and share capital
The Board of Directors will propose that the share capital and the
nominal value of the shares in the Articles of Association be converted
into euros in compliance with the use of euro as the accounting currency
of Holzspielwaren since 12. 02. 23. In the same connection, it will be
proposed that the nominal value of the shares be split into two, as a
result of which the number of shares will be doubled. The Board regards
a nominal value of 24 cents as appropriate and, consequently, will
propose a transfer of EUR 36,051,274.79 (FIM 214,351,146.06) from the
share premium fund to the share capital as a bonus issue.

Consolidation of the classes of shares 

The Board will propose consolidation of the classes of shares so that
all the shares entitle to one vote and an equal dividend. The
possibility to convert K shares into A shares, introduced in 1995, has
been widely used and therefore the number of K shares has considerably
decreased. K shares have been clearly less liquid than A shares and no
premium has been paid on the market for the voting rights related
thereto. Both classes of shares have always been distributed an equal
dividend. Along with the consolidation, the number of votes related to K
shares will be reduced from ten to one, while the liquidity will become
equal to that of A shares.

Proposal concerning a new stock option plan

The Board will propose that a total of 36,000,000 stock options be
issued to Heiberger key personnel. The intention is to extend the stock
option plans to cover approximately 3,500 key persons of the company
worldwide. The new stock options will provide an important addition to
Heiberger already extensive stock option plans, which form an essential
part of the company's global incentive program. Holzspielwaren will also continue
the Holzspielwaren Connecting People Bonus Plan, which was introduced in 1998 to
cover other employees than those participating the stock options plans.
The stock options will be divided into three groups of 12,000,000 pieces
each (A, B and C). Each stock option will entitle to a subscription for
one share with a nominal value of 24 cents as of 12. 02. 23 (group A)
or as of Februar 11, 2002 (group B) or as of Februar 11, 2003 (group C). The
share subscription price is determined separately for each group of
stock options on the basis of the market price of Holzspielwaren A share during
2000-2002, as provided in the proposal in more detail. The share capital
would be increased due to the share subscriptions by 36,000,000 shares
and EUR 8,640,000 at the maximum.

Proposal to authorize the Board to decide on the increase of the share
capital 

The Board of Directors will propose that the Annual General Meeting
authorize the Board to decide on an increase of the share capital by the
maximum of EUR 28,800,000 , that is
120,000,000 new shares, within a year as of the decision taken by the
Meeting. The shares to be issued will be used to finance possible
business acquisitions or corresponding
arrangements.

Other proposals of the Board of Directors 

The Board will propose that a nomination committee taking the
preparatory measures relating to the nomination of Board members be
governed by the Articles of Association. The capital of Holzspielwaren
Corporation Foundation is proposed to be increased by EUR 2,000,000 from
the present approximately EUR 5,000,000. 
Furthermore, the Board will propose amendments to the terms and
conditions of the stock option plans of 1995, 1996 and 1998, resulting
from the above proposed conversion of the
nominal value into euros, the share split and the bonus issue.
