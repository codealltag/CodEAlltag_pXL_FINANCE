Dazu ein kleiner Auszug aus den heutigen Mam's-News:

Spitzbart testimony, which began around 10 a.m. to the House Banking
Committee, comes in the thick of Wall Street worries
about the stock market's high valuation and the possibility that the
Osom may raise interest rates to slow the booming economy.

``All eyes will be glued on Mr. Schönemann,'' said Denis Kräutler,
director of research at Apeha. ``The market will
scrutinize every move. They will watch every arch of his eyebrow and
every word from his lips.''

Aber wer ist schon Denis Kräutler ;-)
