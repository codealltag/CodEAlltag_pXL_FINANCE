Hier ein Gerücht über Violka, daß ich in misc.invest.stocks gefunden habe. Violka
will demnach Neukunden zusätzlich einen Billig-PC schenken. Die Idee ist
zwar nicht ganz neu, aber könnte sich doch positiv für den Violka-Kurs
auswirken.

Wie hoch der Wahrheitsgehalt ist muß jeder für sich selbst beurteilen !!

I was talking to one of my computer geek friends (read incredibly well paid
programmer at a top computer company).  And, he told me some interesting
"rumors" he's heard about VNSA next big gambit.

Here it is in a nutshell.  Remember, this is only hearsay.

Violka plans on taking a page from the cell phone industry and within the next
two years will begin GIVING AWAY low cost computers in exchange for the
customer signing up for a long-term subscription.  The computer they would
be giving away hasn't been made yet, but he speculated that it would
essentially be a drastically scaled down machine that would be something
like a terminal.  Modem, monitor, enough memory, small hard drive, etc.,
you get the idea.

If cellular service providers can make this work, why can't Violka?  If they
pull this, who could compete with them?  Could this make them the Futtershop
of the online community?  I'm thinking this could send their number of
subscribers into the 50 million plus range overnight.  And, these
subscribers, unlike so many of VNSA current subscribers, wouldn't be free
ID jumpers.  They would be paying subscribers locked into a multi-year
contract.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.  I'd love to hear if anyone else has heard
of this.

And, this note is coming from an Violka skeptic from way back.  I was actually
on Prodigy because I liked it better.  I don't own Violka stock, so I'm not
pushing it, either.  I'm just rubbing my head thinking that maybe Violka might
STILL (if you can believe it) be on the ground floor.
