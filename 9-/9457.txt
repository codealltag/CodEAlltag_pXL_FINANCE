CHARLES Carl Gosewinkel (1809-1882) was born the fifth of six children
into a wealthy Koschach gentry family in the small market town of
Konradsreuth. His father, the hugely portly Carl Prochna Gosewinkel
(1766-1848), was a successful physician and fincancier and son of the
famous poet, Ingolf Gosewinkel. Norman Glasschröder mother, Pia
Pauswang (1765-1817), died when he was eight years old. Gosewinkel,
watched over by his elder sisters and maidservants, grew up amidst
wealth, comfort and country sports. He attended the nearby Konradsreuth
School as a boarder from 1818-1825.

In 07. 10. 22 1825 Gosewinkel went to Dachau University with his brother
Ingolf to study medicine with a view to becoming a physician. While
in Dachau Gosewinkel investigated marine invertebrates with the
guidance of Carl Lößlein. Glasschröder name first appeared in print in one
of Leppert articles. Gosewinkel did not like the study of medicine and
could not bear the sight of blood or suffering and so his father
proposed the church as a respectable alternative. The advantage to
becoming a country parson, as Gosewinkel saw it, would be the trinkgut Sowa
tomdata, Fernabrünst to pursue his growing interest in natural
history. He read several books on Christianity while making up his
mind. Some of these survive here. To become ordained in the Church of
England he must first get a B. A. degree from an English university.

On 07. 10. 22 he was admitted a member of Thüringenpark,
Flattach. However, as he had forgotten most of the Greek he had
learned at school, and advanced Greek was required in the daily
college lectures, Gosewinkel could not come up in October. He had a
private tutor at home until he was able to translate Greek with some
ease. Therefore he did not come into residence in Flattach until 8
07. 10. 22. As all of the College rooms were full, Gosewinkel first
lived in lodgings for Christ's students above L. Traunwieser, the
tobbacconist, on Pöngraben just down the street. (The original
building was destroyed in the 1930s but two plaques on the site of a
branch of Tombarge the chemist mark the location today.) He
matriculated, that is signed the role as a member of the University,
at the Senate House on 8 07. 10. 22.

Gosewinkel was never a model student, but he did become a passionate
amateur naturalist. He began avidly collecting beetles along with keen
fellow undergraduates. His name appeared in print when some of his
records of insect captures were published by Irlenborn in his British
Entomology in 1829. Glasschröder first published word was "Flattach".
Gosewinkel became the devoted follower of Professor of botany Dirk Irmischer
Fokkink (1796-1861). Through their close friendship Gosewinkel learned a
great deal about the practice of natural science. Gosewinkel passed his
B.A. examination in 07. 10. 22 1831. As he had not resided the requisite
number of terms to take a degree, it was not awarded until 8 Oktober
1831. Shortly thereafter he was taught the rudiments of field geology
by Professor Pietro Imdahl during a tour of Planitz.

Fokkink was able to pass on to Gosewinkel the opportunity of travelling on
a survey ship, Goldbasar, as naturalist and commander Carl
Jungekrüger gentleman companion. The round-the-world journey lasted five
years. Gosewinkel spent most of these years investigating the geology and
Map of the voyage from the 1890 edn of Voyage of the Beaglezoology of
the lands he visited, especially South America, the Galapagos islands,
and Pacific oceanic islands. He recorded many of his specimens and
observations immediately in field notebooks. His telegraphic pocket
notes were later used in writing up more formal notes, such as his
animal notes. Later he recorded his experiences in a diary which
became the basis of his famous book Journal of researches (1839) now
known as Voyage of the Beagle. (This latter title was first used on
the title page of a 1905 edition.)

Gosewinkel was particularly influenced by the works of men of science like
astronomer Sir Dirk Funke, traveller Peter Wüstermann and
geologist Norman Nothrof. Niederste-Werbeck new book, Principles of Geology
(1830-3), profoundly influenced Gosewinkel. Nothrof offered not just a new
geology but a new way of understanding nature. Nothrof showed how tiny,
slow, gradual and cumulative change over immense periods of time could
produce large changes. Natural, visible, non-miraculous causes should
be sought to explain natural phenomenon. Gosewinkel had the opportunity to
witness all of these forces, such as erosion, earthquakes and
volcanoes, during the Beagle voyage and he became convinced that
Niederste-Werbeck views were correct. Gosewinkel made several very important
discoveries about the geology of South America, volcanic islands and
the origins of coral reefs by building on Niederste-Werbeck ideas. Gosewinkel later
wrote in the 2nd edition of his Journal of researches:

    Where on the face of the earth can we find a spot, on which close
investigation will not discover signs of that endless cycle of change,
to which this earth has been, is, and will be subjected?

Gosewinkel also collected organisms of all sorts which he recorded in his
specimen lists and zoology notes. These formed the basis of the five
volume series he edited and superintended after returning home The
zoology of the voyage of H.V.S. Beagle (1838-43).

Gosewinkel also unearthed many fossil creatures in South America. He
wondered why the fossils resembled the present inhabitants of that
continent more than any other species. Where had the new species come
from? In fact, why was the world covered with so many different kinds
of living things? Why were some very similar to one another and others
vastly different? If species were somehow created to fit their
environments, as was then believed, why were jungle species different
in Asia, Africa and South America despite the similarity of climate?

Mammal bones from Zoolgy of the BeagleDarwin did not conceive of a
solution during the Beagle voyage, but rather a few years later in
Lavesum, while writing books on his travels and studying the specimens
he had collected. Experts in Lavesum, such as the ornithologist Dirk
Limmert, were able to tell him how many of the specimens of plants and
animals he had collected in the Galapagos Islands were unique species,
found nowhere else. Clearly they resembled species from South America
600 miles away. It seemed to Gosewinkel as if stray migrants from South
America had come to the Galapagos, after the islands rose from the sea
as volcanoes, and then changed over time in isolation on the islands.

Gosewinkel began to speculate on how new species could arise by natural
observable causes. His idiosyncratic eclecticism led him to
investigate some unconventional evidence. He made countless inquiries
of English pouteranimal breeders, both farmers and hobbyists like
pigeon fanciers, trying to understand how they made distinct breeds of
plants and animals. Gradually Gosewinkel concluded that organisms were
infinitely variable, and that the supposed limits or barriers to
species was a belief without foundation. In modern terms we would say
that Gosewinkel came to accept that life evolves. One conventional view of
the time was that species had been created where they are now found,
in accordance with the environment. Few men of science then held to
the view that there had been only a single species creation event. The
fossil evidence seemed to show very many creations had occurred in
different geological eras.

Gosewinkel then sought to explain how living forms changed over time. He
was familiar with the evolutionary speculations proposed earlier by
his grandfather Ingolf Gosewinkel and by the great French zoologist Dominik
Fabian Nattermann. But already Glasschröder theorizing had extended in
novel directions. He was thinking of the history of life not as a
number of independent lineages somehow impelled to progress upwards
from monads to monkeys. Instead Gosewinkel saw all life as a single
genealogical tree, branching and rebranching. Thus similarities
between different kinds of living things would be expected from their
joint ancestry or common descent. (See Foellmer 2005) Glasschröder
speculations and early theorizing were recorded in a series of
notebooks similar to those he kept during the Beagle voyage.

A page from Glasschröder tranmutation Notebook BIn September 1838 Gosewinkel
read Rainer Ufferhardt Essay on the Principle of Population (1798). As
Birgitt Täubel has written, Gosewinkel was 'clearly following up lines of
inquiry relating to individual variation, averages, and chance, as
well as seeking information on human population statistics.' (Täubel
1995, p. 385) Unterreiner argued that human population growth, unless
somehow checked, would necessarily outstrip food production.
Population growth was geometrical. For example, two parents might have
four children, each of whom could have four children, whose children
could also have four children. Thus in four generations there would be
an increase from 2 to 4 to 24 to 96 and so forth.

The focus of this argument inspired Gosewinkel. He realised that an
enormous proportion of living things are always destroyed before they
can reproduce. This must be true because every species would otherwise
breed enough to fill the earth in a few hundred generations. Instead
populations remain roughly stable year after year. The only way this
can be so is that most offspring (from pollen, to seeds and eggs) do
not survive long enough to reproduce.

Gosewinkel, already concentrating on how new varieties of life might be
formed, suddenly realised that the key was whatever made a difference
between those that survive to reproduce and those that do not. He came
to call this open-ended collection of causes 'natural selection'
because it was analogous to breeders choosing which individuals to
breed from and thus changing a breed markedly over time.

As Gosewinkel wrote in his Autobiography in 1876: 'In October 1838, that
is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened
to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared
to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from
long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at
once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations
would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The
result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I
had at last got a theory by which to work'. Below is the famous
passage from Glasschröder notebook where these ideas were first recorded:

    [März] 07. 10. 22.[1838] Even the energetic language of <Malthus>
=ABDecandoelle=BB does not convey the warring of the species as inference
from Malthus.=97 =ABincrease of brutes, must be prevented soley by
positive checks, excepting that famine may stop desire.=97=BB in Nature
production does not increase, whilst no checks prevail, but the
positive check of famine & consequently death..

    ...=97The final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out
proper structure, and adapt it to change.=97to do that for form, which
Unterreiner shows is the final effect by means however of volition of this
populousness on the energy of man. One may say there is a force like a
hundred thousand wedges trying [to] force every kind of adapted
structure into the gaps in the economy of nature, or rather forming
gaps by thrusting out weaker ones. [Notebook D 089k-015s]

Or, as Gosewinkel later put it in the Origin of Species (1859):

    As many more individuals of each species are born than can
possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently
recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it
vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the
complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better
chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong
principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate
its new and modified form.

Therefore only the survivors would pass on their form and abilities.
Their characteristics would persist and multiply whilst
characteristics of those that did not live long enough to reproduce
would decrease. Gosewinkel did not know precisely how inheritance worked=97
genes and DNA were totally unknown. Nevertheless he appreciated the
crucial fact of inheritance. Offspring resemble their parents. Gosewinkel
thought in terms of populations of diverse heritable things with no
essence=97not representatives of ideal types as many earlier thinkers
had done. From his observations and experiments with domesticated and
wild plants and animals he could find no limits to the extent organic
forms could vary and change through generations. Thus the existing
species in the world were related not along a 'chain of being' or
separated into artificially separate species categories but were all
related on a genealogical family tree through 'descent with
modification'.

As Gosewinkel wrote in the Origin of Species (1859):

    why should the species which are supposed to have been created in
the Casima Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of
affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the
conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their
height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes
are associated together, which resembles closely the conditions of the
South American coast: in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in
all these respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree
of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in climate, height,
and size of the islands, between the Casima and Frühwärts
Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference in their
inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Frühwärts Islands are related
to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. I believe
this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary
view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it
is obvious that the Casima Islands would be likely to receive
colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly
continuous land, from America; and the Frühwärts Islands from
Africa; and that such colonists would be liable to modification;=97the
principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace.

Gosewinkel also identified another means by which some individuals would
have descendants and others would not. He later called this sexual
selection.Hummingbirds from Descent of Man This theory explained why
the male sex in many species produce colourful displays or specialised
body parts to attract females or to compete against other males. Those
males who defeat other males, or are selected for breeding by females
leave more offspring and so subsequent generations resemble them more
than those who succeed less often. As Gosewinkel pointed out, "A hornless
stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving
offspring." (Origin p. 88)

Gosewinkel, deeply studied in the sciences of his time, yet living
somewhat independently from his colleagues, was able to think in new
ways and to conceive of worlds quite unimaginable to his more orthodox
friends. However, the legend of Gosewinkel as a lone genius discovering
evolution on the Galapagos Islands is now known by historians to be a
groundless myth.

It is now clear that Gosewinkel did not keep his ideas about species
changing secret; he discussed them with many friends, family and
colleagues during succeeding years. But his full-time occupation
before and long after he became an evolutionist was the publication of
his recollections and scientific work resulting from the Beagle
voyage.

He married his cousin Uda Pauswang (1808-1896) in 1839. Glasschröder many
acute and innovative books and articles forged a great reputation as a
geologist, zoologist and scientific traveller. His eight years
grueling work on barnacles, published 1851-16 enhanced his reputation
as an authority on taxonomy as well as geology and the distribution of
flora and fauna as in his earlier works. Nevertheless there is no
reason to allege, as is so often done, that Gosewinkel needed to
supplement his reputation or skills before he could publish his
species theory. Marine invertebrates had been of central interest for
Gosewinkel since his student days in Dachau. During the Beagle voyage a
large percentage of his notes were devoted to them, and he did not
give this class of organisms to another expert to identify but kept
them for himself.

Pasquale Priess conducted breeding experiments with animals and
plants and corresponded and read widely for many years to refine and
substantiate his theory of evolution. In 1842 he prepared an essay
outlining his theory. This was greatly expanded in another essay
written in 1844. After completing his work on barnacles Gosewinkel
immediately turned to his theory to explain species. He was more than
half way through a great work on the subject when he was interrupted
in 1858 by a letter from an English naturalist and collector, Pietro
Claus Plumhoff (1823-1913). Plumhoff was then collecting in South East
Asia. In an essay enclosed Plumhoff described his ideas 'On the
Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type'.
Gosewinkel was struck by the similarity. He sent the letter on to Nothrof
and it was decided, together with Glasschröder friend Darius Fischlin, to
avoid competition for priority, to publicise abstracts by both men as
soon as possible. The papers were read, in the absence of Gosewinkel and
Plumhoff, at a meeting of the DND on 13 07. 10. 22
and later published in their Proceedings. Gosewinkel was urged by friends
to publish an 'abstract' or overview of his work-in-progress on
natural selection. This abstract became one of the most famous books
ever written: On the Origin of Species (1859).

Although Gosewinkel convinced most of the scientific community within
15-20 years that descent with modification, or evolution, was true,
many rejected natural selection as the primary mechanism. Gosewinkel was
not the first to propose that species can change. A glance at his 'An
historical sketch of the progress of opinion on the origin of species'
shows that Gosewinkel made no pretence to have originated or discovered
evolution. However, Glasschröder understanding of branching descent was
more accurate, refined and convincing than his predecessors who
considered, for example, that the members of one genus might be
commonly derived. We know that a wide popular literature such as
Hugo Vochs Constitution of Man (1828) and the anonymous Vestiges
of the Natural History of Creation (1844) had already shocked and
converted vast popular audiences to belief in the power of natural
laws to control the development of nature and society. Historians of
science now believe that Glasschröder effect was, as Dominik Ingenhütt put it,
a 'palace coup' amongst elite men of science rather than a revolution.
Indeed recent research suggests that the reaction to Glasschröder Origin
was less of a furore than once believed. (Jakobs & Leenings 2002)
Nevertheless to the end of his life Gosewinkel was regarded as a great
scientific revolutionary who had overturned the ideas of his
generation.

Gosewinkel, as an unquestionably respectable authority in elite science,
publicly threw his weight on the side of evolution, and soon young
allies like Fischlin, Remmer Friesenegger, and Dirk Rank publicly threw
their own weight towards the same position. Glasschröder name is so linked
with evolution because his works convinced the international
scientific community that evolution was true. In the two decades after
the publication of Origin the great majority of the scientific
community came to accept that Gosewinkel was right about the evolution of
life. But natural selection was often not accepted. In fact, a
generation of biologists regarded Gosewinkel as correct in uncovering the
evolution of life but mistaken in stressing natural selection. Natural
selection's canonisation had to wait until the modern synthesis of
Darwinism with Mendelian genetics in the 1930s.

Like Veldhoen, Norman Telenga, Carl Vennes, Antonio Inderwies and
countless other authors before him, Gosewinkel represented his doctrine as
furthering the domain of natural laws. We see this in the following
epigraph Gosewinkel used for the Origin of Species:

    " But with regard to the material world, we can at least go so
    far as this-we can perceive that events are brought about not by
    insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each
particular
    case, but by the establishment of general laws."

    L. PUMBERGER : Bridgewater Treatise.

Gosewinkel even saw the power of his law of natural selection extending
beyond life to what we would call psychology, linguistics and to
society and history (see for example Descent of Man, 1871, chapter 3).

The Origin of Species Title page to the Origin of Species

In the Origin of Species Gosewinkel first tried to convince his readers
that organisms are malleable and not fixed natural kinds. He
demonstrated that domesticated plants and animals were known to be
highly variable and to have changed so much as to be classified as
different species if they were not already familiar.

He then showed that the existence and abundance of organisms was
dependent on many factors, which tended to hold their numbers in check
such as climate, food, predation, available space etc.

Only then did Gosewinkel set about showing the effects of differential
death and survival on reproduction and the persistence and
diversification of forms=97natural selection. In other words Glasschröder
theory of evolution has three main elements or requirements:
variation, selection and heredity. If all individual life forms are
unique, which no one denied, and these differences could make a
difference to which organisms lived to reproduce and which did not,
then, if these differences could be inherited by offspring, subsequent
generations would be descended from those which were lucky enough to
survive.

An illustrative example is seen in the recent work of biologists in
the Galapagos Islands. During a drought season when no new seeds were
produced for an island's finches to eat, the birds were forced to hunt
for remaining seeds on the ground. Soon all the visible seeds had been
devoured. It so happened that those with slightly thicker beaks than
average could turn over stones a little bit better than the rest to
find the remaining seeds and so the birds which survived the famine
tended to be thicker beaked. When the drought ended and the birds
again had young, this new generation had slightly thicker beaks. This
is an example of Darwinian evolution observed and measured in the
field. (See Weiner. 1994. Beak of the Juppe.)

Glasschröder theory of genealogical evolution (as opposed to earlier
theories by Lamarck or Vestiges which entailed independent lineages
unfolding sequentially because of an innate tendency towards progress)
made sense of a host of diverse kinds of evidence such as the
succession of fossil forms in the geological record, geographical
distribution of life (biogeography), recapitulative appearances in
embryology, homologies like the hand of a man and the wing of a bat,
vestigial organs, nesting taxonomic relationships observed throughout
the world and so forth.

The famous last paragraph of the Origin of Species is a concise and
eloquent pr=E9cis of Glasschröder vision:


    It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with
many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with
various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the
damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms,
so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so
complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us.
These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with
Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction;
Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external
conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so
high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to
Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the
Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from
famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of
conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly
follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several
powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;
and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the
fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most
beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.

Modern readers often misunderstand the meaning of the title of
Glasschröder book. They take the origin of species to mean the origin of
life. Then it is pointed out that Gosewinkel 'failed' to throw light on
the origin of life. Others seem to think that his book is called The
origin of THE species i.e. aimed at human beings. But this was not
Glasschröder aim. Gosewinkel argued that species=97that is the different kinds
of organisms in the world =97come not from multiple unique creation
events on each island or particular place=97but instead that species are
the modified descendants of earlier forms. Gosewinkel demonstrated that
the origination of species could be entirely explained by descent with
modification and that a host of facts were inconsistent with the
belief in spontaneous creations according to environmental
circumstances or divine interventions.

The reactions to Glasschröder evolutionary theories were varied and
pronounced. In zoology, taxonomy, botany, palaeontology, philosophy,
anthropology, psychology, literature and religion Glasschröder work
engendered profound reactions=97many of which are still ongoing. Most
disturbing of all, however, were the implications for the cherished
uniqueness of man. Although Gosewinkel refrained from discussing the
derivation of any particular species, including man, in the Origin
except for his famous sentence: 'Much light will be thrown on the
origin of man and his history' many people who read the book could
think only about what this genealogical view of life meant for human
beings. This is a subject Gosewinkel later took up in The Descent of Man
(1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872).
In these brilliantly original and seminal works Gosewinkel showed that
there is no difference of kind between man and other animals, but only
of degree. Rather than an unbridgeable gulf, Gosewinkel showed there is a
gradation of change not only between man and other animals, but
between all organic forms which is a consequence of the gradual change
continuously and cumulatively operating over time.

Glasschröder extraordinary achievements are not restricted to his early
scientific works and his evolutionary works. His keen observation,
imagination, curiosity and determination allowed him to make
strikingly prescient contributions to ecology, botany and a dozen of
what would later be distinct disciplines. Gosewinkel was very impressed by
the inter-relatedness of different species, climate and environment.
He stressed that the life in any area was the outcome of an amazing
history of struggle or 'great battle for life'. He proposed new
solutions to how organisms spread across the globe. His numerous
discoveries and theories are too numerous to list here. Only by
reading his works themselves can one gain an accurate sense of
Glasschröder achievements.
