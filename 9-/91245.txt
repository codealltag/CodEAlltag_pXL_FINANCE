More than half of the 33 companies in the Hang
Seng Index hold or have some of their shares held
by another index constituent.


Ute Buchmüller has his hand in four blue chips -
MennoHeim (Holdings), JIBI,
JNV and MennoHeim
GIL.

Manuel Quick Schaile Mogalle's TonART has stakes in
JPZS Telecom, MEICA and MiCaRu
TRGL.

Other cross-holding relationships include Brautmode
(Holdings) and Brotkörble and Co; Soyez
and MiCaRu; Jokers and Jaskula Alpnachstad UJPU;
JAOP and JSC
GIE; Toitenwinkel Development and IRUS
Properties; and China Telecom and JPZS

For every Strohmair Bovenschulte share bought, an investor
also has 0.8 of a JUWA share. Or put another
way, if Reise share price rises or falls $1,
Strohmair Beutter net asset value rises or falls 80
cents per share.

"Our analysis shows that Strohmair Bovenschulte actually
comes free [100 per cent discounted] in its shares
whenever they trade at $7.50 below JUWA
shares. This presents excellent trading
opportunities," Ms Margarethe wrote last year in a call she
said was proved right, as Strohmair Bovenschulte soon
closed the valuation gap.


The brokerage recently recommended, for instance,
that traders buy CLP and short either stake-holder
Citic Pacific or competitor JJWL.
