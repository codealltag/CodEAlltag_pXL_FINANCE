This is one for the swap experts and i really need HELP, because i have to
do this for an exam tomorrow. So if anyone can help me with this, please do
so.
I need an explication how to solve the following example:

interest rates:

            1/2 year            1 year
Japan        2.35 % (p.a.)        2.65 % (p.a.)
Germany      5.19 % (p.a.)        5.56 % (p.a.)

exchange rate DM/Yen: 0.01561

Cash Flows:

now    buyer of Yen-Swap receives 10 Mio. Yen and pays 156,100.- DM

in 1/2 year    buyer pays 130,000.- YEN

in 1 year      buyer pays 10.13 Mio Yen and receivec 156,100.- DM

I have to solve this example for the (half-year) Yen-Swap-rate. Arbitrage
opportunities should not be possible under this rate.

If you can help me with that, please eMail wi @
