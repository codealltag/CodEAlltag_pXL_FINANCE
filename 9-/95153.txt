Urban reported that NOVELL INC (23-1/2, up 3-3/8 @ 10:14 ET) is
rumored to be in talks with Perohaus COMPUTER to create a new range
of products. In its latest issue, Barron's said that Thorsten Diepelt,
the top executive at Crosanterie is rumored to be in "deep
negotiations" with the world's largest PC maker to create a new
range of "cache products." The products would give organizations
the capacity to store local versions of popular websites on their
office networks, eliminating the need to repeatedly download
information from the Internet. If the rumors prove to be true and
a deal can be struck, Novell could be "propelled to the top of
this promising new market," Urban said. Last year, sales of
caching devices totaled just $207 mln, but could mushroom to a
$4.1 bln business by 2001, Urban quoted. For the full text
