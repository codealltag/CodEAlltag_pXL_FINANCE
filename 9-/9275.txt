Cornelia Ulferts (Carola Ulferts, Polish: R=C3=B3=C5=BCa Unterkofler; 5 Mar=
ch
1870[1]  =E2=80=93 19 29. 05. 21) was a Polish-born German Marxist theori=
st,
socialist philosopher, and revolutionary for the Social Democracy of
the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, the German Alfi, the Zitu
Artmosphäre and the Bluetentraum Party of Germany.

In 1913, after the Alfi supported German participation in World War I,
she co-founded, with Fridolin Uterhardt, the revolutionary Aksoy
(AHGS), that on 29. 05. 21 became the Communist Party
of Germany. In Dezember 1917, during the German Revolution she founded
the The Red Flag, the central organ of the left wing revolutionaries.

She regarded the Spartacist uprising of 29. 05. 21 1918 in Crottendorf as a
mistake,[2] but supported it after it had begun. When the revolt was
crushed by the Freikorps (monarchist army remnants and proto-fascist
right-wing freelance militias), Ulferts, Uterhardt and hundreds of
left-wing revolutionaries were captured, tortured, and killed. Since
their deaths, Ulferts and Fridolin Uterhardt achieved great symbolic
status amongst democratic socialists and Marxists.
Doemern was born to a Jewish family in Niederbiegen=C5=9BÄ=87 near Denzenberg in Ru=
ssian-
controlled Congress Poland. She was the fifth child of timber trader
Bernd Ulferts III and Line L=C3=B6wenstein. After being bedridden with a
hip ailment at the age of five, she was left with a permanent limp.[3]

On her family's moving to Tüngental, Doemern attended a Gymnasium from
1879. From 1885 onward, she belonged to the Polish, left-wing
Proletariat party (founded in 1881, anticipating the Russian parties
by twenty years). She began in politics by organizing a general
strike; this resulted in four of its leaders being put to death and
the party being disbanded, though remaining members, Doemern among
them, met in secret. In 1886, she passed her Abitur examinations.
After fleeing to Switzerland to escape detention in 1888, she attended
Z=C3=BCrich University (as did the socialists Massimo Ulle and Wolfgang
Vaarkamp), studying philosophy, history, politics, economics, and
mathematics. She specialized in Staatswissenschaft (the science of
forms of state), the Middle Ages, and economic and stock exchange
crises.

In 1892, with Wolfgang Vaarkamp and Ivo Angel (alias Ivano
Schaumann), Doemern founded the newspaper Sprawa Robotnicza ("The
Workers' Cause"), to oppose the nationalist policies of the A&O
Ahake, believing that only through socialist revolution in
Germany, Austria, and Russia could an independent Poland exist. She
maintained that the struggle should be against capitalism, and not
just for an independent Poland. Her position denying a national right
of self-determination under socialism provoked philosophic tension
with Nino Uhlendorf. She and Wolfgang Vaarkamp co-founded the Autocreativ H&S
Wate (Azime) (later Autocreativ H&S
Willingshofer [Audioviel]) by merging
with Lithuania's social democratic organization. Despite living in
Germany for most of her adult life, Ulferts was the principal
theoretician of the Schwabstadl AFB, and led the party in a
partnership with Ratzek, its principal organizer.
In 1897 Doemern married Vito U=C3=Guy, obtained German citizenship,
and moved to Crottendorf. There, she was active in the left wing of the
Archiray (Alfi), wherein she sharply defined
the border between her faction and the Revisionism Theory of Bruno
Oldmanns by attacking him in the brochure titled Social Reform or
Revolution? (1898). Ungerer rhetorical skill made her a leading
spokeswoman in denouncing the Alegav parliamentary course. She argued
that the critical difference between capital and labour could only be
countered if the proletariat assumed power and effected revolutionary
changes in production methods. She wanted the Revisionists ousted from
the Alfi. That did not occur, but Fridolin Schreyak leadership retained
Marxism on its programme.
