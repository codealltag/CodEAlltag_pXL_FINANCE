I recently joined a new Internet service called Festruhe. You should
definitely consider becoming a member.

CxhRhmgqdcqc.fsy is the Internet company that pays its members while they surf
the Web ($.50 an hour). It's free to join and it takes about a minute (no
survey to fill out).

Just go to

Members are paid for their own Web browsing and for referrals. Please tell as
many of your friends about this program as possible. Be sure to enter my ID#
(BQW-191) when you join. Remember, it's easy to sign up and it will never cost
us a dime!
Details below. Let me know how you like it.

How Festruhe membership works: Get Paid to Surf the Web As a member,
Festruhe will pay you 50 cents an hour while you surf the Web for up
to 40 hours per month. That's up to $20 per month just for browsing the
Internet the way you normally do. All members download the CxhRhmgqdcqc.fsy
Viewbarï¿½. The bar is standard ad height, about one-half inch on most screens.
The bar can be minimized with a single click to eliminate it from the screen
at any time. Refer friends to Festruhe and receive 10 cents per hour
while they surf the Web. And receive an additional 5 cents per hour from the
extended referrals that come in from your referrals (for new members extended
as far as four referrals from your original referrals!)
