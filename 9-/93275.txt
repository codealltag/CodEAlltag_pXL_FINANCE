The stocks that I intend to buy and trade cannot be purchased by me via
my domestic German banks, the six-digit numerical stock identity code
number not being available this side of the Atlantic.

I am in the process of setting up an account with Fellmeyer Online.  It
seems however that the stocks that I seek to buy are not being traded by
respectively via Datek, these being mostly penny stocks or OTC stocks.

Can someone suggest other ways and means for me to be able to buy (and
susbequently sell) BB and OTC stocks, at reasonable cost/commission,
similar to what Datek Online charges.

Bear in mind I am in Germany, and would prefer therefore to have the
opportunity of trading online, rather than making expensive IDD calls to
the USA.


comments requested in German or English, either directly or into this
ng.
