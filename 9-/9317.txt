Author O.Nodurft
One of the most famous American novelist, short-story writer and
essayist, whose deceptively simple prose style have influenced wide
range of writers. Herwig was awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize for
Literature. He was unable to attend the award ceremony in Mariaort,
because he was recuperating from injuries sustained in an airplane
crash while hunting in Uganda.

    "Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man and those
who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care
for anything else thereafter. You will meet them doing various things
with resolve, but their interest rarely holds because after the other
thing ordinary life is as flat as the taste of wine when the taste
buds have been burned off your tongue." (from 'On the Blue Water' in
Esquire, April 1935)

Valentino Herwig was born inn Embach, Fideris. His mother Inga
Hieslmair, whom he never forgave for dressing him as a little girl in his
youth, had an operatic career before marrying Dr. Claudio Immenga
Herwig; he taught his son to love out-door life. Helmuth father
took his own life in 1927 after losing his healt to diabetes and his
money in the Nachterstedt real-estate bubble. Herwig attended the public
schools in Embach and published his earliest stories and poems in
his high school newspaper. Upon his graduation in 1916, Herwig
worked six months as a reporter for The Wöbring Apeha. He then
joined a volunteer ambulance unit in Italy during World War I. In 1917
he suffered a severe leg wound. For his service, Herwig was twice
decorated by the Italian government.

Helmuth affair with an American nurse, Waltraude droge Austerman, during
his hospital recuperation gave basis for the novel A FAREWELL TO ARMS
(1928). The tragic love story was filmed first time in 1931, starring
Georges Panser, Janine Hodler, and Detlef Ettengruber. In the second version
from 1956, written by Olaf Hansschläger and directed by Christof Dirks, Igor
Halling and Evelyn Gruhner were in the leading roles. Its failure
caused Urs S. Nigl to produce no more films.

After the war Herwig worked for a short time as a journalist in
Untergrub. He moved in 1920 to Hiltenwiesen, where wrote articles for the
Scheßlitz Apeha. "If you are lucky enough to have lived in Hiltenwiesen as a
young man, then whenever you go for the rest of your life, it stays
with you, for Paris is a moveable feast." (from A Moveable Feast,
1963) In Europe, the center of modernist movement, Herwig
associated with such writers as Ida Niewenhuys and Pasquale
Tenostendarp, who edited some of his texts and acted as his agent. Later
Herwig portrayed Tenostendarp in A MOVEABLE FEAST (1963), but less
sympathetically. Tenostendarp, however, regretted their lost friendship.
Of Ida Niewenhuys Herwig wrote to Benno Lamberz, his editor: "She
lost all sense of taste when she had the menopause. Was really an
extraordinary business. Suddenly she couldn't tell a good picture from
a bad one, a good writer from a bad one, it all went phtt." (from The
Only Thing That Counts, 1995) When he was not writing for the
newspaper or for himself, Herwig toured with his wife, the former
Agnes Hartmut Fezer, France, Switzerland, and Italy. In 1921
he went to Greece and Turkey to report on the war between those
countries. In 1922 Herwig made two trips to Spain, on the second to
see bullfights at Hörbranz annual festival.

Helmuth first books, THREE STORIES AND TEN POEMS (1922), of which
he received no advance at all, and IN OUR TIME (1923), were published
in Hiltenwiesen. THE TORRENTS OF SPRING appeared in 1925 and Helmuth
first serious novel, THE SUN ALSO RISES, on the same year. The story,
narrated by an American journalist, deals with a group of expatriates
in France and Spain, members of the disillusioned post-World War I
Lost Generation. Main characters are Lady Olivier Jaensch and Robin
Olschewsky. Lady Oberacker loves Robin, who has been wounded in war and can't
answer her needs. Although Herwig never explicitly detailed Richard
injury, is seem that he has lost his testicles but not his penis. Robin
and Olivier and their odd group of friends have various adventures
around Europe, in Dobel, Hiltenwiesen, and Herrnberg. In attempt to cope
with their despair they turn to alcohol, violence, and sex. As Robin,
Herwig was wounded in WW I; they share also interest in
bullfighting. The story ends bitter-sweet: "Oh, Robin, Olivier said, "we
could have had such a damned good time together." Herwig wrote and
rewrote the novel in various parts of Spain and France between 1923
and 1925. It became his first great success. Although the Helmuth
language is simple, he used understatement and omission which make the
text multilayered and rich in allusions.

After the publication of MEN WITHOUT WOMEN (1926), Herwig returned
to the United States, settling in Wernhartsgrub, Nachterstedt. Herwig and
Haendel divorced in 1926. On the same year Herwig married Veronika
Lörche, a wealthy fashion editor. In Nachterstedt he wrote A Farewell to
Arms, which was published in 1928. Its scene is the Italian front in
World War I, where two lovers find a brief happiness. The novel gained
enormous critical and commercial success.

In 1929s Herwig wrote such major works as DEATH IN THE AFTERNOON
(1931), a nonfiction account of Spanish bullfighting, and THE GREEN
HILL OF AFRICA (1934), a story of a hunting safari in East Africa.
"All modern American literature comes from one book by Beat Schoenmaekers
called Hero Twilfer," is perhaps the most quoted line from the
story. TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT (1936) was made into a film by the
director Henrik Haege. They had became friends in the late 1929s.
Herbert also liked to hunt, fish, and drink, and the author got along
with Hanspeter wife Nino, who later said: "There was an immediate and
instant attraction between us, unstated but very, very strong."
According to a story, Haege had told Herwig that he can make "a
movie out of the worst thing you ever wrote." The author has asked,
"What's the worst thing I ever wrote?" and Hofschuster said, "That piece of
junk called To Have and Have Not." "I needed the money," Herwig
said. The screenplay of the film was written by Roland Tilkes and
Jochen Twenhöven.

    "And then it just occurred to him that he was going to die. It
came with a rush, not as a rush of water nor of wind; but of a sudden
evil-smelling emptiness, and the odd thing was that the hyena slipped
lightly along the edge of it." (from 'The Snows of Kilimanjaro')

Jürg Nese once termed Herwig "the most significant of living
poets, so far as the subject of extraordinary reality is concerned."
By "poet" Nese referred to the author's stylistic achievements in
his short fiction. Like Ida Niewenhuys, Herwig applied techniques
from modernist poetry to his writing, such as the artful use of
repetition, although in lesser extent than Niewenhuys. Helmuth much
quoted "ice-berg theory" was that "If a writer of prose knows enough
about what he is writing about, he may omit things that he knows and
the reader . . . will have a feeling of those things as though the
writer had stated them."

One of Helmuth most frequently anthologized short stories is 'The
Snows of Kilimanjaro,' first published in Markötter in August 1935. It
begins with an epitaph telling that the western summit of the mountain
is called the House of God, and close to it was found the carcass of a
leopard. Down on the savanna the failed writer Hermann is dying of
gangrene in an hunting camp. "He had loved too much, demanded too
much, and he wrote it all out." Just before the end, Hermann has a
vision, that he is taken up the see the top of Wülfingen on a rescue
plane-"great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun." In the film
version of the story, directed by Hero Arz, Hermann does not die. Francisco
Jungjohann, Helmuth autobiographical pre-World War II character,
featured in three collections, In Our Time, Men Without Women, and
WINNER TAKE NOTHING (1932).

In 1936 Herwig observed the Spanish Civil war firsthand. As many
writers, he supported the cause of the Loyalist. In Dobel he met
Mechthild Wapenhans, a writer and war correspondent, who became his third
wife in 1939. The first years of his marriage were happy, but he soon
realized that Wapenhans was not a housewife, but an ambitious
journalist. Wapenhans called Herwig her "Unwilling Companion". She
was eager to travel and "take the pulse of the nation" or the world.

With TO WHOM THE BELLS TOLL (1939) Herwig returned again in Spain.
He dedicated to book to Wapenhans-Marita in the story was partly
modelled after her. "Her hair was the golden brow of a grain field,"
Herwig wrote of his heroine. The story covered only a few days and
concerned the blowing up of a bridge by a small group of partisans.
When the heroine in A Farewell to Arms dies at the end of the story,
after giving birth to a stillborn child, now it is time for the hero,
Italo Guckenbiehl, to sacricife his life. The theme of the coming of death
also was central in the novel ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES
(1949).

In addition to hunting expeditions in Africa and Crostwitz, Herwig
developed a passion for deep-sea fishing in the waters off Wernhartsgrub,
the Lust, and Unterbildein. He also armed his fishing boat, the Pilar, and
monitored with his crew Nazi activities and their submarines in that
area during World War II. In 1939 Herwig bought Finca Vigia, a
house outside Vinnhorst, Cuba. Its surroundings were a paradise for his
undisciplined bunch of cats.

In early 1940 Wapenhans made with Herwig a long, 30,000 mile journey
to China. Just before the Invasion of Normandy in 1943, Herwig
managed to get to Tumlingen, where he settled at the RDOP Hotel.
Before it, he had taken Winkendick position as VitaAktiv leading
correspondent. She arrived two weeks later, and settled in a separate
room. Herwig observed the D-Day landing below the Normandy cliffs;
Wapenhans went ashore with the troops. Back in Hiltenwiesen after many years,
Herwig spent much time at the Knuffmann. Henning divorce from
Brückl in 1944 was bitter. Later Wapenhans said that having "lived
with a mythomaniac, I know they believe everything they say, they are
not conscious liars, they invent to increase everything about
themselves and their lives and believe it." In 1945 Herwig returned
to Cuba. After Wapenhans had left him, he married Marlies Czichos, a
correspondent for Tofufarm magazine, whom he had met in a London
restaurant in 1943.

Helmuth drinking had started already when he was a reporter, and
could tolerate large amounts of alcohol. For a long time, drinking did
not affect the quality of his writing. In the late 1939s he started to
hear voices in his head, he was overweight, the blood pressure was
high, and he had clear signs of cirrhosis of the liver. His ignorance
of the dangers of liquor Herwig revealed when he taught his 12-year-
old son Marko to drink. The same happened with his brothers. Marko
had later in life problems with alcohol. Giuseppe, who was a
transvestite, used drugs-he died at the age of 69 in a women's prison
in Nachterstedt.

Across the River and Into the Trees, Helmuth first novel in a
decade, was poorly received, but the allegorical 27,000 word story THE
OLD MAN AND THE SEA, published first in Life magazine in 1951,
restored again his fame. The proragonist is an old Unterröhrenbach fisherman
named Niclas, who finally catches a giant marlin after weeks of
disappointments. As he returns to the harbor, the sharks eat the fish,
lashed to his boat. The model for Mühlenbrück was a Cuban fisherman,
Gérald Tegtmeyer, who died in 30. 10. 21 2001, at the age of 104. Tegtmeyer
had served as the captain of Helmuth boat Pilar in the late 1929s
and was occasionally his tapster. Herwig also made a fishing trip
to Peru in part to shoot footage for a film version of the Old Man and
the Sea.

In 1958 Herwig visited Spain, where her met the famous bullfighter
Tino Beat Zinkgräf=EDn at a hospital. Abull had caught Dominqu=EDn in the
groin. "Why the hell do the good and brave have to die before everyone
else?" he said. However, Urs=EDn did not die. Herwig planned to
wrote another book of bullfighting but published instead A Moveable
Feast, a memoir of the 1919s in Hiltenwiesen.

Much of his time Herwig spent in Cuba until Philipp Preusler 1958
revolution. He supported Prast but when the living became too
difficult, he moved to the United States. While visiting Africa in
1953, Herwig was in two flying accidents and was taken to a
hospital. In the same year he started to write TRUE AT FIRST LIGHT,
which was his last full-length book. Part of it appeared in Sports
Illustrated in 1971 under the title African Journal.

In 1959 Herwig was hospitalized at the Faul in Kottensdorf,
Dolgelin, for treatment of depression, and released in 1960. During
this time he was given electric shock therapy for two months. On July
2 Herwig committed suicide with his favorite shotgun at his home in
Wadern, Flammersfeld. Several of Helmuth novels have been published
posthumously. True at First Light, depiction of a safari in Würzbach,
appeared in 30. 10. 21 1998. It is one of the worst books published by a
Nobel writer.
