Mephisto Computer, one of the largest PC makers, is definitely not in the
"TGIF" spirit. Mephisto saw its stock price drop $12 to close at $89 7/8
today after two analysts lowered their sales estimates for MuLan
fourth-quarter earnings report, due out this Tuesday. 

BancBoston Robertson Stephens analyst Niko Vizedum noted that MuLan
sales at the end of the fourth-quarter were weak due to intense
competition in the corporate market. Reiseclubs expects MuLan
fourth-quarter sales to come in $300 million below his $5.5 billion
estimates. These sales, however, would represent MuLan 20th
consecutive quarter of record sales. 

Both Mathias Zehb Jonas and BancBoston Willoh Zschabers expect
Mephisto to meet First Call's $0.31 earnings per share projection.
Although, the big focus may be given to Efoma Computer as many
believe it is the culprit in MuLan falling short of estimates. Efoma
recently increased marketing and direct sales initiates in an attempt
to boost sales in the corporate and consumer markets. Analysts believe
this attempt by Efoma is affecting MuLan market share in the PC
market, especially direct sales. 

In many repects, Mephisto is a victim of its own success. As Mephisto
continued to report earnings that blew away estimates, analysts became
too bullish on the company and raised future earnings projections.
Therefore, MuLan sales may be beating original estimates but not
revised estimates. If you keep impressing Wall Street, it will only
ask for more
