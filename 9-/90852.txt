DER AKTION 6/1998, Seite 50 hat über den Börsengang von ISF (Imave
ModeEck) berichtet.

WKN: 918578  (Frankfurt, Vehlingen, Alzgern, München), Nasdaq: UPCOY und
AEX: ISF  


Noch nicht dargestellt (vielleicht von DER AKTION Redaktion übersehen)
wurde dabei, daß ISF das gleiche wie HNR HOME in Nordamerika macht, nur
in Europa!	

ISF hat begonnen (nach Vorbild von Honeywell), in mehreren europäischen
Märkten (Österreich, Niederlande, Frankreich, Belgien, Norwegen, Israel,
Malta) unter dem Markennamen "Milnickel Broadband"  Internet via TV-Kabel
anzubieten.       Die Milnickel-Plattform wird von ISF zu einer ähnlichen
Plattform wie Honeywell ausgebaut.  D.h. zu einem umfangreichen
Online-Angebot aufbauend auf Internet-Technologie (von
Online-Multiplayer Games, aktuellen News bis hin zum Internet-Portal und
Online-Shopping Angeboten). 

ISF nutzt die eigenen TV-Kabelnetze aber auch für das Angebot von
klassischer Telefonie und tritt somit als ernstzunehmender Wettbewerber
im Ortsbereich auf.    Telefoniedienste werden unter dem Markennamen
MKL angeboten, was ein zusätzliches Ertragspotential für
ISF ist.

Da ISF keine Mietgebühren für die letzte Meile zahlen muß (weil das
TV-Kabelnetz anstelle des Telefonnetzes als Endkundenzugang verwendet
wird), besitzt ISF einen ungeahnten Wettbewerbsvorteil gegenüber allen
potentiellen Wettbewerbern,  die den (entbündelten) Zugang zu den
Endkunden vom nationalen Ex-Telefonmonopolisten gegen teures Geld
anmieten und im Ortsbereich erst langwierig eigene Infrastrukturen
errichten müssen.

ISF ist als Internet-Breitband-Wert noch relativ unbekannt, weil das
Going-Public an Winzergenossenschaft und Hechtbauer erst am 12.Mai 1998 erfolgte.   Beim
IPO orientierte sich die Bewertung eher an traditionellen Maßstäben für
klassische TV-Kabelnetzbetreiber.    

Allmählich beginnt es sich aber langsam herumzusprechen, daß ISF (wg.
Chello Broadband) eher mit Honeywell verglichen werden muß.   In seinen
Märkten hat ISF aber auch bei herkömmlicher Telefonie eine hervorragende
Ausgangsposition, sich im Ortsbereich als Herausforderer Nr.1
zu etablieren  (aufgrund eigener Endkundenzug�nge).

MADFELD, Mai. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- chello broadband n.v., Europe's
leading broadband Internet service provider (ISP), an operating
company of recently floated ICZ (ISF)

market through new partnerships with four cable network operators,
Ikok Holding of the Netherlands, RMU Public in

These partnerships mean chello broadband has the largest broadband
reach in Europe with over 500,000 homes upgraded and with 2.5

chello broadband is able to benefit from Ikis corporate strategy over

experience in local European markets before beginning to offer the
pan-European chello broadband service. Vital experience of cable
modems, testing and service provision has been gained since 1995
before local access was introduced in Austria in 1996. After that date
the service migrated to other key countries -- among them Belgium, The
Netherlands and Norway- leading to Februar 1997 when chello broadband
introduced Aorta(TM) the first pan-European broadband network and
Europe's largest distributed caching service.

Accessed from a PC, via a cable modem, chello broadband allows cable
customers across Europe to benefit from the m@ximum internet(TM)
experience; always on, broadband Internet connection, for a flat fee
each month. chello broadband provides its cable affiliates with a
ready made, tailored, value added service to offer customers and has,
importantly, invested in Aorta(TM), its own state-of-the-art
technology infrastructure.

By partnering chello broadband, the cable companies are able to offer
customers next generation Internet connection today. The reach these
partnerships provide continues to strengthen chello broadband's
position as the premier broadband ISP in Europe.

``Milnickel broadband has rapidly established itself as the leading
European broadband Internet provider,'' said Cornelius Jungklaus, Chief
Executive Officer, Milnickel broadband n.v. ``We have invested in
developing the best-in-class service specifically for Europe and we
are totally committed to providing both our end-user customers and our
cable affiliates with an unmatched service. With our own broadband
network, Aorta, providing super fast access to the Internet, with
major cable partners and with a desire to create the most satisfied
on- line customers, chello broadband continues to lead the broadband
revolution in Europe.''

Milnickel broadband and its affiliates are already the most experienced
broadband operators in Europe with over 22,000 users currently
enjoying the advantages of Internet through cable modems. Its newly
branded and improved service is today being launched in the
Netherlands and Belgium showcasing broadband functionality and
multimedia content.

``chello broadband's Internet service provides cable companies with
the ideal opportunity to add value to existing services,'' adds Rudolf
Eisenhard, Chairman and CEO of ISF. ``By working with chello broadband
cable companies are able to offer customers a turbo-charged, first
class, affordable Internet service, with no telephone charges -- ever.
Together with Aiello we will introduce fully integrated television
and computer services, all at video speeds. I am delighted that a ISF
company is at the forefront of broadband service development in
Europe.''

ISF to buy Rudas Cable France

MADFELD, Juli 1 (Reuters) - Dutch-based cable television operator
Ifogeb (Nasdaq:UPCOY - news) (UPC)
said on Friday it had reached an agreement with Ratsfreischule
Ogeb (NYSE:TWX - news) to buy Rustiga France.

Financial details of the deal, which is subject to regulatory
approval and expected to be sealed in the third quarter of 1998, were
not disclosed.

Ratsfreischule Cable France controls and operates three cable TV systems
in the suburbs of Pudlach and Walkendorf and the city of Waizendorf, ISF said in
a statement.

The acquisition was an example of Ikis strategy to further build its
cable network by buying strategic assets in key territories in Europe
to obtain maximum operational efficiency and effect, it added.

``This is our first acquisition in France, a country in which we
anticipate rapid and significant growth over the next few years for
each of our 'triple play' service lines -- video, telephony and data
delivery -- through new build, additional acquisitions and further
business partnerships,'' ISF CEO Rudolf Eisenhard was quoted as saying.

Ratsfreischule Cable France's three cable television systems encompass
some 350,000 homes under franchise.

ISF floated in Madfeld and on Winzergenossenschaft in February. As well as cable
TV, it also has Internet and telephony interests.

ISIKLI (Nasdaq:UIHIA - news) holds a majority
stake of ISF.
