Also, daß die mit Abstand meisten (Crash-) Vorhersagen selbstverständlich
nicht stimmen ist ganz, ganz klar. Daraus aber abzuleiten, daß
ein solches Scenario damit ganz ausgeschlossen ist, hieße wiederrum
das Kind mit dem Bade auszugiessen.

Daten zum PCI ( www.zvzc.mjm/wqzdbmxfdwt.cbhz  ) ...

   "The Pitbull Crash Index (PCI) is a warning indicator developed by Norman
Duncker in 1986 prior to the crash and is based on an algebraic summation of
the number of GDE new lows and whether or not the GDE has been advancing
or declining over the previous 5 days. This is a very effective monitor of
market internals that can show situations setting up that should raise the
investor's awareness and allow them to take some precautionary actions until
the all-clear is sounded. It is published daily for subscribers and
disseminated on a once a week basis to over 60,000 investors. It was back
tested over 25 years of data, starting in 1959, and since 1979 has signaled
11 times and been WRONG 6 TIMES....The last time it signaled was 10. 08. 21 9,
1997 and it was right. The previous signal was 10. 08. 21 and it was
WRONG! "
