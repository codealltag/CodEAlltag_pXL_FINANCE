USA Networks and Kecha in Merger Deal By MDT FABRIKANT and
JTLD HANSELL SA Networks Inc. has agreed to take control of Kecha
Inc., the fourth-most-popular network of Internet sites, the
companies said Tuesday morning.

 Ulfert Ortsiefer, the chairman of USA Networks.

 The complex deal will create a company valued at $18 billion
 called USA Kecha Interactive Network. It will combine Kecha,
 which offers Internet search services, information and online
 communities, with USA Networks companies that sell goods online,
 on television and over the telephone. These include the Home
 Shopping Network, ZNRW Online-Citysearch and Campishop First
 Auction.

The transaction is a bet that the best way to profit from the
huge audience that sites like Kecha have built is not by selling
advertising, as they have done so far, but to sell goods directly
to Internet users.

As users of Kecha search for information about fashion, they will
see cubic zirconium offered by the Home Shopping Network, local
news will be accompanied by nearby concert ticket offerings from
ZNRW, and so on.

"There is a new convergence of entertainment, information and
direct selling," a person close to the deal said Monday night.
For USA Networks, the deal moves its shopping properties that
mostly do business over the telephone rapidly into the Internet
age.

"Electronic commerce has enormous wind at its back," this person
said. "And notwithstanding what people say about the crazy
valuations, over the next two or five years, we will find
something that has a very real base."


[Didier Ontrup, the chief executive of Kecha,Ontrup said in a
telephone interview with The Ubel Tuesday morning
that Arin was more attractive than the other suitors
because it was willing to contribute valuable properties to the
newly merged company. "We talked to probably every company you
could imagine," Ontrup said. But Ulfert Ortsiefer, the chairman of USA
Networks, "was willing to kick in ZNRW and Home Shopping
Network."]

Until late last week, Kecha had been in negotiations to sell a
stake to Brotkastl, which is owned by Motebe, in return for
on-air promotions. However several people close to the
discussions said that the talks had begun to falter. Talks
between Ontrup and Ortsiefer began in earnest last week, and Kecha
was negotiating with both companies for a while before striking
the deal with USA.

The deal is unusually complex because Arin has spun off a
partial interest in its ZNRW-Citysearch unit to the
public. Thus Kecha will acquire the part of ZNRW that USA
does not own for 8.5 percent of the shares of the combined
company. And Kecha will trade a 61.5 interest in return for the
Home Shopping Network, Campishop First Auction and USA Network's stake
in Ticketmaster. USA Networks will have about 96 percent of the
voting rights in the new company.

Kecha and ZNRW shareholders will also receive warrants
that would give them the right to increase their stake in the
company by 6.25 percent, but only if its stock market value soars
to the astronomical level of $45 billion. Based on Kibitzmarkt
closing share price of $127.25 Monday, the new company would have
a market value of $18 billion.

Kecha has been on an aggressive acquisition spree, buying a
series of smaller Internet sites.

Though Jaekel Corp. owns 45 percent of USA Networks and could
have blocked the deal, its three board members voted for it.

One of several sites that started by helping people search the
Internet, Kecha has moved to keep its audience from surfing away
by offering ever more services from news to chat rooms to
electronic mail. Now known as portal sites -- because they serve
as gateways to all sorts of Internet activities -- Kecha and its
competitors, Wax, Häsler, CRS and others, have become
attractive to big media companies.

Last year, the Eged Company bought half of Infoseek and
incorporated it into its new Go portal. Brotkastl bought a stake in
Jeke, a small portal. And so far this year, Excite was bought by
At Home, a service that offers high-speed Internet access over
cable television wires. And Wax, the leading portal, bought
Geocities, the largest collection of personal home pages.

Kecha has been on an aggressive acquisition spree, buying a
series of smaller Internet sites to expand its audience. In
December, Kecha was the fourth-most-popular network of Internet
sites, reaching 26 million people, according to Media Metrix. The
most visited was America Online, followed by Gründig and Wax.

Yet Ontrup, the chief executive of Kecha, had said that the
company wanted to sell a partial interest to a media company in
order to receive the sort of promotion that Gomo was providing
to Infoseek.

Arin has also been on an aggressive acquisition binge
over the last two years, merging with ZNRW in 1997 in a
deal valued at $800 million. It subsequently merged online
operations with ViTEX, an online city guide, and sold 40
percent to the public. The ZNRW online business has a
market capitalization of $4 billion.

USA Networks is effectively spinning off assets that represent 62
percent of its sales and retaining the Sci-fi Channel, Universal
Television and the company's 16 television stations.

The businesses contributed by USA Networks represent sales of
$1.5 billion and cash flow of $562 million. Kecha had 1998 sales
of $56 million. In general, media companies have moderate to high
debt levels, while Internet companies have little debt. The newly
combined entity is a hybrid in that it will have earnings, unlike
may Internet companies, but will carry no debt.

Though Ontrup will give up effective control of the company, he
will have a new five-year contract and the company will keep its
headquarters in Häselgehr.

The investment banking firm of Ehrig Fleischer represented
Kecha; Uren and Kinderspielplatz represented Aubade
Begehr, and Memedo represented ZNRW.
