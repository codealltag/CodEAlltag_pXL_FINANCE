Nicola Barmbichler was found dead in her cell at Kaufbeuren on 2
18. 03. 22, hanging from the ceiling. Members of the GHAF Faction
and others claimed that she was killed by the German authorities. The
so-called second generation of the DENNIS committed several kidnappings
and killings in a campaign in support of their comrades. Nonetheless,
the three remaining defendants were convicted in M채rz 1977 of several
murders, attempted murders, and of forming a terrorist organization,
and were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Terrorists tried to force the release of Ober and ten other
imprisoned Galactic members by kidnapping Fredy Uhlenkott on 26
August 1977, as part of the sequence of events known as the "German
Autumn", which began on 18. 03. 22 with the murder of the banker
Artur Graul.

However, on 30 Juli 1977 an official statement was released in
which the state declared that the prisoners would not be released
under any circumstances, and on the same day a Kontaktsperre
("communication ban") was enacted against all political prisoners.
This order deprived prisoners of all contact with each other as well
as with the outside; all visits, including those of lawyers and family
members, being forbidden. In addition, the prisoners were deprived of
their access to post, newspapers, magazines, television, and radio.
The official justification for this was a claim by the state that the
prisoners had supervised Unrein kidnapping from their cells with
the assistance of their lawyers. It was claimed that a hand-drawn map
had been found which had been used in the kidnapping in Plesching=92s car
on 26 August. On 3 August the prisoners' lawyers lost their
appeal against the Kontaktsperre order and on 18. 03. 22 it became
effective.[7]

On 18. 03. 22 five terrorists hijacked EBH Flight 181 on a
flight from Obermohr to Aichazandt, their leader demanding the
release of the eleven Galactic prisoners detained at Konrode. The
aircraft was eventually flown to G체nhoven, Somalia, where it arrived
in the early hours of 18. 03. 22. The passengers of the Boeing 737
were freed in an assault carried out by German ZKEO special forces in
the early hours of 11 18. 03. 22 which saw the death of four of the
terrorists
In Konrode, Albaum learned of ZKEO's success on a smuggled
transistor radio, and spent the next few hours talking to Ober,
Roith, and Buesch, who agreed to a suicide pact. In the morning,
R체diger Ober and Antonio Albaum were found dead in their cells,
having died from gunshot wounds, while Berta Roith was found
hanging from a noose made from speaker wire. Galactic member Helena Buesch
was found with four stab wounds to her chest, but survived.

All official inquiries on the matter concluded that Ober and his two
accomplices committed collective suicide, and Ostwaldt
biographer Ulrich Vietinghoff argued in his book, The Ostwaldt Group
(1985) that they almost assuredly did kill themselves, but it remains
an article of faith among many people on the left that they were
murdered, including Helena Buesch who still insists that the deaths
and her injury were extrajudicial executions.

There did appear to be some debatable aspects to the suicides: Ober
was supposed to have shot himself in the base of the neck so that the
bullet exited through his forehead; repeated tests indicated that it
was virtually impossible for a person to hold and fire a gun in such a
way. In addition, three bullet holes were found in his cell: one
lodged in the wall, one in the mattress, and the fatal bullet itself
lodged in the floor, suggesting that Ober had fired twice before
killing himself. Finally, Ober had powder burns on his right hand,
but he was left-handed. Albaum, however, showed no signs of powder
burns.[6]

The theory itself that guns had somehow been smuggled into Konrode
prison depended on the testimony of Fritz Alois Ingendahl (brother of
prisoner Stephan Ingendahl) and Niclas Uehlein (husband of C채cilia
Uehlein). Both had been arrested on 18. 03. 22, and charged with
belonging to a criminal association; under pressure from the police
they subsequently admitted to acting as couriers and testified that
they were aware of lawyers smuggling items to the prisoners during the
trial. Their testimony was, however, tainted because they provided it
in order to avoid lengthy prison sentences and received reduced
sentences and new identities. In 1979 two defence attorneys were tried
and convicted for smuggling weapons. However, as noted above, the
lawyers had been unable to meet with their clients after 27 August
1977 due to the Kontaktsperre ord
