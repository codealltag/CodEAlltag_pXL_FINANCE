This week I received some e-mail messages from members of these 
gambling newsgroups about my ROULETTE SYSTEM.

I must say that at this moment I am not interested to sell my system,
I am only interested to trade it with another very good roulette system.

I don't figure I have forever to play this system, thus I'm keeping my 
options open for other systems. Perhaps if I keep switching between 
two systems, it'll confuse security. Perhaps with two systems can be
created that phase which would really confuse the security.


I must say that I have seen many, many roulette and baccarat systems
but a lot of them do not work as well as player would wish. I do not
like the systems which are very agresive and which use a large bankroll
because we all know that this kind of the systems do not work.

If you have very good roulette or baccarat system for which you are sure
that works very well for you, then write me on my e-mail address:

I am very an honest and trustworth guy and I know keep the best things
confidential and I want that the partner is the same kind of person too.

I also want that both sides have benefits not only one side.

If you have something very interesting then please, let me know.

I've had good luck from three casinos (we are talking online, right?): Casino


Pacifics: www.AiymgnRmfiuthku.rqe
caribe: (www.rsxkvvuvxlfg.jqw), Casino EPFW (www.ckotvd7ka8.hlo), and Trage
Middelgaal (www.g9kcnmh.nns). They are basically the same with some cosmetic
differences. I've never had a problem with them, have pretty much come close
to breaking even (that's as good as you can expect), and there's no download
involved (I've got an old, slow modem, so downloading isn't an option). There
are tons of online casinos around, but Caribe has been in the business for
over a year now and is stable.


Thanks.
