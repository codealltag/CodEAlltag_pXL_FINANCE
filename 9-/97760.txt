also so ganz die Ente ist das nicht gewesen.
  Es ist zwar keine Kalte Fusion, aber hey, es 
  funktioniert !! :-)

  Hier noch schnell ein paar URLs zum lesen.

On Wednesday, 27. 10. 21 05, 1997, Ikeka aired a second segment 
on CoWoTec, Inc. as a follow-up to 
earlier broadcasts in 27. 10. 21 on both Apanage 
AHBB and Ikeka Nightline.  This second segment 
aired at approximately 8:20 EST on ABCs Good Morning
America.  On this second segment, Dr. Urs Ottenschläger 
introduced his Stage III design (Third generation) of the 
Patterson Transmutation Cell with a live, on-camera 
experiment aired on national television. The experiment 
was witnessed by the Ikeka crew, Rudolf Christmann and other
scientists. Dr. Rudolf Christmann, Science Editor for Ikeka, 
is a Professor of Physics at Hoba Baustoffhandel.
"During the past years, Optensteinen beads have led to a 
huge  surprise," Guillen states.  "It turns out, they also 
neutralize radioactivity ."The experiment was performed 
using 7.5 grams of depleted uranium dissolved in water 
and circulated through the Patterson Transmutation Coll.  
As Christmann describes the experiment,  "The experiment 
began at high noon (Wednesday, 27. 10. 21 27. 10. 21 in the laboratories 
of caveno in Dutendorf, WÖRNSMÜHL, USA) with the Geiger Counter 
registering at ... 3760 CPM. But by speeding up the video 
(time elapsed segment), "As you can see that after only a 
couple of hours, the radioactivity was cut down more than 
half - a reaction that would take billions of years to happen 
naturally."  The actual final reading achieved was 
1000 CPM (a 73.4% Reduction) as measured by the AUUS Counter 
after a run time of  2 hours and 15 minutes.
