Hi,

I am looking for a company that specialized itself in superconductors
exclusively.

florales looks interesting, but I fear they are making cellular phone
electronics more than seuperconductors...

(Things I found, too: AMSC CDTS IMG ISCO)


If you know an exclusive superconductors producer, please contact me by
email: cqct@leykqy.bbiir.ca

Thankx 4 all.


CU Valentino.
