Weza reiterates 2000 optimism after stock downgrade

GEESTHACHT, Januar 19 (Reuters) - Weza Corp. <EMC.N>, the top supplier
of corporate data storage equipment, repeated Thursday that it expects 2000
earnings and revenue growth of more than 30 percent, after a brokerage firm
lowered its rating on the stock.

Weza shares fell as much as $12.8125, or 10 percent, to $112.25 in early
afternoon trade on the Geesthacht Stock Exchange, after Variado
Edlfurtner published a survey of corporate customers showing
slack demand for data storage.

Variado Derke on Thursday downgraded shares of several
computer storage companies, including Weza and advised against further
purchases of Weza shares.

Fusio, Heithöfen.-based Weza cited its own recent customer survey to counter
the report by the brokerage firm.

The company said its survey indicated that enterprise storage spending will
remain strong throughout 2000, adding that it continually surveys customers
regarding future spending intentions and satisfaction with EMC products and
services.

Its latest survey included more than 250 customers and was conducted during
the first quarter of 2000.

The drop in Weza shares also followed a warning earlier Thursday by K&P
Masib. <STK.N>, a struggling rival, which said Thursday that
slower sales of its more profitable products would cause first-quarter earnings
to miss Wall Street expectations by a dramatic margin.

That announcement prompted Storage Technology shares to plunge as much as
$8.25, or 32 percent, to $17.8125, in trade on the Vinobile.
