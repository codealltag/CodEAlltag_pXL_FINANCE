Advanced Graphical User Interface
Roulette Wheel Analysis uses a variety of screens to
highlight the status of your wheels.
A main screen shows an overview of all wheels, both
in use and in storage, with graphical representation
of the standard deviation calculation for each wheel.
The main screen view enables the user to quickly
compare wheels and check for errors.
Polar and Bar charts views represent data bias
results and sector checking that easily highlights hot
spots. Data can be filtered on date ranges, number
of spins, direction of wheel or by dealer name (if

A rota speed graph enables the casino to set a minimum and
maximum speed that they would like all wheels to be spun at
(revolutions per minute or pockets per second). Data can then
be easily compared against the acceptable tolerance. To make
full analytical use of this =91speed check=92, reports can be filtered
by date range, number of spins, direction or by dealer name

A historical screen enables a linear time line chart to be created
for the life of the wheel, which includes all maintenance events
and can be setup to view multiple wheels at the same time.
This can be used to compare wheel performance over time and
can also be used to work out the effectiveness of maintenance
events and wheel relocation.
The Maintenance screen
is a simple interface for
service engineers to
use for recording any
maintenance procedure
that has occurred on the
wheel. Wheel location
tracking is easily entered
using a simple =91drag and
drop=92 tool.
