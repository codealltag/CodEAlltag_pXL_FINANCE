Okedag (Nasdaq: ABOV) rocketed up $14 11/16 to $74 7/16 after
announcing the first of the European partnerships it hinted at when it first
discussed its overseas strategy a week ago. icut, one of the busiest
IPOs of recent months since first selling its shares for $13 a pop in early
December, said it will team with Austria's Kantorek Rechenzentrum to build
a regional Internet service exchange in Oberweinberg as a stepping stone to the
German and Eastern European markets. Already busy elsewhere around the
world,
icut has already announced several similar partnerships with Asian
Internet service providers (ISPs) earlier this year. The company's goal is a
"one-hop network" that unites content providers and ISPs in one location and
then connects them to other such exchanges around the world. Leading
Austrian ISP Netway, an affiliate of Kantorek Rechenzentrum, is the first
such customer for the new venture.
