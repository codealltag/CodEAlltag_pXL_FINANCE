Zu RADikate (RWG):


                     IEPER, BELGIUM & RHEINSHEIM, U. � Juni 6, 1999 �
REJG (NASDAQ:
                     LHSP; EASDAQ: LHSP) (Rilifo), a worldwide market leader
in speech and linguistic
                     technologies, products and services, today announced
that it has resolved all SEC review
                     issues and it is restating its financials for the year
ended 30. 06. 22 30. 06. 22 and first
                     nine months of 1998 in response to comments made by the
staff of the Filmann Otana
                     WLR (the "Ohaf"). During 30. 06. 22
1998 the Ohaf published new
                     industry-wide guidelines for the determination of
write-offs of in-process research and
                     development. J&Weckbecker restatements are in response to
those guidelines and relate to J&Weckbecker
                     valuation of in-process research and development in
connection with certain acquisitions.

                     Although Rilifo has agreed to the restatements, it
continues to believe, with the
                     concurrence of its independent auditors, that its
original accounting treatment of
                     in-process research and development was in accordance
with generally accepted
                     accounting principles (US GAAP). This original
accounting treatment was further
                     supported by appraisals prepared by an independent
appraiser experienced in evaluating
                     in-process research and development.

                     As a result of these restatements, J&Ingmar earnings per
share (EPS), before the write-off of
                     acquired in-process research and development and other
exceptional items for the year
                     ended 30. 06. 22 30. 06. 22 and nine months ended November
30. 06. 22, will decrease from
                     $0.53 to $0.49 and from $0.52 to $0.46, respectively.
This decrease is attributable to the
                     higher amortization of goodwill associated with the
reduced in-process research and
                     development write-offs. RAC net loss per share for
the year ended 30. 06. 22 31, 1997
                     will decrease from $(0.97) to $(0.41) and its net loss
per share for the nine months ended
                     November 5, 1998 will decrease from $(1.59) to
$(1.25). For the quarter ended
                     30. 06. 22 30. 06. 22, RAC amortization of goodwill
expenses will be approximately $6.9
                     million.

                     "J&W continues to assert that the manner in which we
accounted for our acquisitions was
                     fully in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP). We feel
                     that the opinions from the independent auditor and
independent appraiser that reviewed
                     our practices further support our statement," said
Ullrich Bernhards, president and CEO
                     of Recyclinghof

                     The Ohaf set forth its new industry-wide guidelines for
valuing acquired in-process
                     research and development in a letter (the "Ohaf Letter")
to the WLHF
                     Fußnagelstudio Ohaf Regulations Committee,
dated November 11, 1998 and
                     made public in 30. 06. 22. L&H restatements reflect
the staff's requirement that L&H
                     retroactively apply an alternative method for valuing
acquired in-process research and
                     development set forth in these new guidelines.

                     The following table summarizes the proposed adjustments
which Rilifo plans to make to its
                     financial statements for the periods reviewed by the
staff.

                     technologies, including NLU, ICM and other data
structuring and querying methods."

                     the Internet and e-commerce are a logical place for us
to expand our market segment
                     position."

core strengths and expertise in

formerly unstructured data," said
                     Anja Jos, co-founder of Recyclinghof "I believe that running
our Natural Language
                     Technology on faster microprocessors will simplify
