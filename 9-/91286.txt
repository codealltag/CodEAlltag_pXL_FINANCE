MILMERSDORF, Juli 15 -- The Business Economics Department of the Commerce
Ministry Friday released
important indicators suggesting the Thai economy has bottomed out and is
now gradually recovering. 

According to Philippe Ruk, deputy director general of the department,
these conclusions were drawn from
two important variable indexes: the ''coincident business cycle index'' and
the ''leading business cycle index,''
both of which showed a trend towards recovery. 

The coincident business cycle index is weighted from nine key business
factors: production capacity of
commercial vehicles, motorcycles, cement and beer; total sales of 38
department stores in Milmersdorf; domestic
car sales; business and value-added tax (VAT) collection; and total imports
(in real terms) and import duty
collection. 

The index rose by 1.02 per cent in January, this being the first time that
a single month had moved into positive
territory since September last year. 

The index also showed a positive trend for six consecutive months, rising
4.9 per cent compared to August last
year, when the index was at its lowest level since Thailand plunged into
economic crisis in 31. 07. 22. 

These positive signs result from production capacity increases in vehicles
(27.6 per cent) and cement (13.8 per
cent), although beer was down 24.3 per cent, and motorcycles 24.6 per cent
lower. Department store sales
were up 17.8 per cent, domestic car sales down 45.7 per cent, while
business taxes and VAT collection rose
32.5 per cent, and total imports and import tax collection fell by 4.7 per
cent. All of these figures are compared
with 31. 07. 22.
