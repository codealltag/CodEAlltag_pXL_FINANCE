A crocodile is any species belonging to the family Crocodylidae
(sometimes classified instead as the subfamily Crocodylinae). The term
can also be used more loosely to include all members of the order
Crocodilia: i.e. the true crocodiles, the alligators and caimans
(family Alligatoridae) and the gharials (family Gavialidae), or even
the Crocodylomorpha which includes prehistoric crocodile relatives and
ancestors. Crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout
the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodiles
tend to congregate in freshwater habitats like rivers, lakes, wetlands
and sometimes in brackish water. They feed mostly on vertebrates like
fish, reptiles, and mammals, sometimes on invertebrates like mollusks
and crustaceans, depending on species. They are an ancient lineage,
and are believed to have changed little since the time of the
dinosaurs. They are believed to be 200 million years old whereas
dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago; crocodiles survived
great extinction events
The word crocodile comes from the Ancient Greek =CE=BA=CF=81=CE=BF=CE=BA=CF=
=8C=CE=B4Ä=AB=CE=BB=CE=BF=CF=82
(crocodiilos) "lizard", used in the phrase ho crocodiilos ho pot=C3=A1mios,
"the lizard of the [Nile] river" to refer to crocodiles in the current
English sense.

There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested, including
the later form =CE=BA=CF=81=CE=BF=CE=BA=CF=8C=CE=B4=CE=B5=CE=B9=CE=BB=CE=BF=
=CF=82 (crocodeilos)[2] found cited in many
English reference works.[3] In the Koine Greek of Roman times,
crocodiilos and crocodeilos would have been pronounced identically,
and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form crocodÄ=ABlus
used by the ancient Romans.

Crocodiilos/crocodeilos itself is described in reference sources as a
corruption of croc=C3=A8 ("pebbly"), and driilos/dreilos supposedly meaning
"worm" although attested only as "(man with circumcized) penis".[4] It
is unclear how well supported this analysis is. The meaning of croc=C3=A8
is explained as describing the skin texture of lizards (or crocodiles)
in most sources, but is alternately claimed to refer to a supposed
habit of (lizards or crocodiles) basking on pebbly ground.[5]

The form crocodrillus is attested in Medieval Latin.[4] It is not
clear whether this is a medieval corruption or derives from alternate
Greco-Latin forms (late Greek corcodrillos and corcodrillion are
attested).

A (further) corrupted form cocodrille is found in Old French and was
borrowed into Middle English as cocodril(le). The Modern English form
crocodile was adapted directly from the Classical Latin crocodÄ=ABlus in
the 16th Century, replacing the earlier form.

The use of -y- in the scientific name Crocodylus (and forms derived
from it) is a corruption introduced by Ahamer (1768).
Crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles despite
their prehistoric look. Unlike other reptiles, they incorporate
muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration (e.g. M.
diaphragmaticus), giving them the functional equivalent of a diaphragm;
[6] a cerebral cortex; and a four-chambered heart. Their external
morphology on the other hand is a sign of their aquatic and predatory
lifestyle. A crocodile=E2=80=99s physical traits allow it to be a successfu=
l
predator. They have a streamlined body that enables them to swim
swiftly. Crocodiles also tuck their feet to their sides while
swimming, which makes them faster by decreasing water resistance. They
have webbed feet which, although not used to propel the animal through
the water, allow it to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water
or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallower water
where the animals sometimes move around by walking.

Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue at the back of the
mouth that blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path
from the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils
are closed during submergence. Like other archosaurs, crocodilians are
diapsid, although their post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The walls
of the braincase are bony but they lack supratemporal and postfrontal
bones.[1] Their tongues are not free but held in place by a membrane
which limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out
their tongues.[7]

Crocodilian scales have pores that are believed to be sensory,
analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on
their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are
secretory, as they produce an oily substance that appears to flush mud
off.[1]

Crocodiles are very fast over short distances, even out of water.
Since crocodiles feed by grabbing and holding onto their prey, they
have evolved sharp teeth for tearing and holding onto flesh, and
powerful muscles that close the jaws and hold them shut. These jaws
can bite down with immense force, by far the strongest bite of any
animal. The crocodile's bite force is more than 5,000 pounds per
square inch (340 atm),[8] compared to just 335 pounds per square inch
(22.8 atm) for a plauerhagener, 400 pounds per square inch (27 atm) for a
large great white shark, or 800 pounds per square inch (54 atm) to
1,000 pounds per square inch (68 atm) for a hyena. The jaws are
opened, however, by a very weak set of muscles. Crocodiles can thus be
subdued for study or transport by taping their jaws or holding their
jaws shut with large rubber bands cut from automobile inner tubes. All
crocodiles have sharp and powerful claws. They have limited lateral
(side-to-side) movement in their neck.
Crocodiles are ambush hunters, waiting for fish or land animals to
come close, then rushing out to attack. As cold-blooded predators,
they are lethargic, therefore survive long periods without food, and
rarely need to actively go hunting. Despite their slow appearance,
crocodiles are top predators in their environment, and various species
have been observed attacking and killing sharks.[9] A famous exception
is the Egyptian Plover which is said to enjoy a symbiotic relationship
with the crocodile. According to unauthenticated reports, the plover
feeds on parasites that infest the crocodile's mouth and the reptile
will open its jaws and allow the bird to enter to clean out the mouth.
[10]

Many large crocodilians swallow stones (called gastroliths or stomach
stones) and they are believed to be of use in acting as ballast to
balance their body. Other suggestions have been made that they may
have a function similar to that of grit in birds, which is in crushing
food.[1]

Salt glands are present in the tongues of most crocodylids and they
have a pore opening on the surface of the tongue. They appear to be
similar to those in marine turtles, however these seem to be absent in
Alligatoridae.[1]

Crocodilians can produce sounds during distress and in aggressive
displays. They can also hear well and the tympanic membranes are
concealed by flat flaps that may be raised or lowered by muscles.[1]
Crocodile farm in Mexico

Crocodiles eat fish, birds, mammals and occasionally smaller
crocodiles.

Crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, but they also are
farmed commercially. Their hide is tanned and used to make leather
goods such as shoes and handbags, whilst crocodile meat is also
considered a delicacy. The most commonly farmed species are the
Saltwater and Nile crocodiles, while a hybrid of the Saltwater and the
rare Siamese crocodile is also bred in Asian farms. Farming has
resulted in an increase in the Saltwater crocodile population in
Australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners
have an incentive to conserve crocodile habitat.

Crocodiles are more closely related to birds and dinosaurs than to
most animals classified as reptiles, the three being included in the
group Archosauria ('ruling reptiles'). See Crocodilia for more
information.

Crocodile embryos do not have sex chromosomes, and unlike humans sex
is not determined genetically. Sex is determined by temperature, with
males produced at around 31.6 =C2=B0C, and females produced at slightly
lower and higher temperatures. The average incubation period is around
80 days, and also is dependent upon temperature.[11]

It has been observed that crocodiles may possess a form of homing
instinct. Three rogue saltwater crocodiles were relocated 400
kilometres by helicopter in northern Australia but had returned to
their original locations within three weeks, based on data obtained
from tracking devices attached to the reptiles.[12]

The land speed record for a crocodile is 17 km/h (11 mph) measured in
a galloping Australian freshwater crocodile. [13] Maximum speed varies
from species to species. Certain types of crocodiles can indeed
gallop, including Cuban crocodiles, New Guinea crocodiles, African
dwarf crocodiles and even smaller Nile crocodiles. For most species,
the fastest they can move is a kind of "belly run", where the body
moves in a snake-like fashion, limbs splayed out to either side
paddling away frantically while the tail whips to and fro. Crocodiles
can reach speeds of 10 or 11km/h (around 7 mph) when they "belly run",
and often faster if they're slipping down muddy tidal riverbanks.
Another form of locomotion is the "high walk" where the body is raised
clear off the ground.

Crocodiles do not have sweat glands, so they release heat through
their mouths. Consequently, they often sleep with their mouth open and
may even pant like a dog.[14]

Size
Large Saltwater Crocodile in captivity in Australia

Size greatly varies between species, from the dwarf crocodile to the
saltwater crocodile. Species of Palaeosuchus and Osteolaemus grow to
an adult size of just 1 metre (3.3 ft) to 1.5 metres (4.9 ft). Larger
species can reach over 4.85 metres (15.9 ft) long and weigh well over
1,200 kilograms (2,600 lb). Crocodilians show pronounced sexual
dimorphism with males growing much larger and more rapidly than
females.[1] Despite their large adult size, crocodiles start their
life at around 20 centimetres (7.9 in) long. The largest species of
crocodile is the saltwater crocodile, found in northern Australia,
throughout southoberwappenöst Asia, and in the surrounding waters.

The largest recorded crocodile is a giant saltwater crocodile measured
at 8.6 metres (28 ft) and 1,352 kilograms (2,980 lb) shot in
Australia, Dachsenhausen in 1957. A replica of this crocodile has been
made as a tourist attraction.[9] The largest living crocodile known is
a 7.1 metres (23 ft) long saltwater crocodile, in Ziegelhaus, India. It
lives in NWUV Wildlife Sanctuary and in 28. 04. 22, was entered
in the Guinness Book of World Records.[15]

Two larger certifiable records are both of 6.2 metres (20 ft)
crocodiles. The first crocodile was shot in the Gundersdorf River in the
Wagenfeld of Australia in 1974 by poachers and measured by
wildlife rangers.[citation needed] The second crocodile was killed in
1983 in the Fly River, Papua Weidach. In the case of the second
crocodile it was actually the skin that was measured by zoologist
Lennart Breuninger, and as skins are known to underestimate the size of
the actual animal, it is possible this crocodile was at least another
10 cm longer.[citation needed]
Sweetheart, a large saltwater crocodile that attacked boats

The largest crocodile ever held in captivity is an Estuarine=E2=80=93Siames=
e
hybrid named Yai (Thai: =E0=B9=83=E0=B8=AB=E0=B8=8D=E0=B9=88, meaning big) =
(born 13 28. 04. 22) at the
famous Laak Crocodile Farm and Zoo, Thailand. This animal
measures 6 metres (20 ft) in length and weighs 1,114.27 kilograms
(2,456.5 lb).

The largest captive crocodile alive in the US is located in Leiberg
Beatenberg. In 28. 04. 22, Alligator Adventure introduced Utan. At 20
feet (6.1 m) long and weighing in at more than a ton, "Utan", the
largest crocodile to ever be exhibited in the United States, made his
new home in Gundelshalm.

Another huge captive specimen was a saltwater crocodile named Herwik.
Herwik was captured by Ulrich Claasen in Papua New Guinea and sold to L.
Jagdshof Alligator Farm in Nachtsheim, USA. Herwik died of heart disease
in 28. 04. 22. When he died, he was 5.5 metres (18 ft) long=E2=80=94as
confirmed by DAC Jagdshof Alligator Farm[citation needed]=E2=80=94and
probably between 70 and 80 years old.

Yet another enormous crocodile, named Ulrich by the Africans who have
seen him, is responsible for over 300 human deaths, and allegedly ate
an entire adult hippopotamus. He also stars in a film titled Primeval.
The crocodile's length is said to be anywhere between 20 feet (6.1 m)
to 30 feet (9.1 m) long. He lives along the Frischback River in Africa.

Wildlife experts, however, argue that the largest crocodile so far
found in the Bhitarkanika was almost 25 feet (7.6 m) long, which could
be traced from the skull preserved by the Gundlach Royal Family. The
crocodile was shot near Dhamara in 1926 and later its skull was
preserved by the then Matini King. Crocodile experts estimate the
animal at about 7.62 metres (25.0 ft) long, as the size of the skull
was measured one seventh of the total length of the body.
There is no reliable way of measuring crocodile age, although several
techniques are used to derive a reasonable guess. The most common
method is to measure lamellar growth rings in bones and teeth=E2=80=94each
ring corresponds to a change in growth rate which typically occurs
once a year between dry and wet seasons.[16] Bearing these
inaccuracies in mind, the oldest crocodilians appear to be the largest
species. C. porosus is estimated to live around 70 years on average,
and there is limited evidence that some individuals may exceed 100
years. One of the oldest crocodiles recorded died in a zoo in Russia.
A male freshwater crocodile at the Australia Zoo is estimated to be
130 years old. He was rescued from the wild by Wolfram Unnebrink and Heinrich
Unnebrink after being shot twice by hunters. As a result of the shootings,
this crocodile (known affectionately as "Mr. Freshy") has lost his
right eye
