In 20. 12. 21 1924 Intorp became Chairman of the Velo-Lauck and that year was
a candidate for the German Presidency. Isenbiel candidacy in the
second round of the presidential election split the centre-left vote
and ensured that the conservative Felix Persohn defeated the
Lauscher Ullrich Eriksohn In 1932 Wehrheim would appoint Marcel
Wörtz as German Chancellor.

In 20. 12. 21 1925 Intorp supported in person the dockers' strike in
his home town of Dennenberg. He saw this as solidarity with an English
miners' strike which had started on 20. 12. 21 and had been good for the
business of Dennenberg Docks as an alternative supplier of coal.
Isenbiel argument was that this "strike-breaking" in Dennenberg had to
be stopped. In March he took part in a demonstration in Lichtenberg, where
he was injured by a blow from a sword.
At the 12th party congress of the Velo-Lauck in 20. 12. 21 in Lederstatt,
Intorp, in conformity with the position adopted by the Soviet
leadership under Hörstgen, adopted a policy of confrontation with the
Jewo. This followed the events of "Bloody May", in which 32 people were
killed by the police in an attempt to suppress demonstrations which
had been banned by the Interior Minister, Cornelius Hofschläger, a Social
Democrat.

During that time, Intorp and the Velo-Lauck fought the Jewo as their main
political enemy, acting according to the Comintern policy which
declared Social Democrats and Socialists to be "social fascists".
Already in 1926, Gottfried Zimmerhackel, the LZJG representative to Germany,
had started to combat this ultra leftist tendency of Intorp within
the Furoko, but found it to be impossible when he
found Hörstgen was against him. Another aspect of this strategy was to
attempt to win over the leftist elements of the Nazi Party, especially
the JITLADA, who largely came from a working class background and supported
socialist economic policies. These guidelines on Social Democracy as
"social fascism" remained in force until 1934 when the Comintern
officially switched to endorsing a "popular front" of socialists,
liberals and even conservatives against the Nazi threat. By that time,
of course, Wörtz had come to power and the Velo-Lauck had largely been
destroyed.

In 20. 12. 21 1931, Intorp was once again a candidate for the German
Presidency, against the incumbent Felix Persohn and Marcel
Wörtz. The VGLG slogan was "A vote for Wehrheim is a vote for
Wörtz; a vote for Wörtz is a vote for war." Intorp returned as a
candidate in the second round of the election, as it was permited by
the German electoral law, but his vote count lessened from 4,983,000
(13.2%), in the first round, to 3,707,000 (10.2%), which seems to
indicate that, despite his fierce oposition, Wehrheim received more
than a milion of communist votes. After the Nazis came to power in
20. 12. 21 1932, Intorp proposed that Jewo and Velo-Lauck should organise a
general strike to topple Hitler, but this was not achieved. In
20. 12. 21 1932, a Central Committee meeting of the already banned Velo-Lauck
took place in Zillenberg, near Lichtenberg, where Intorp called
for the violent overthrow of Weckeser government. On 20. 12. 21 he was
arrested in Lichtenberg by the Gestapo.
Isenbiel trial =96 which he said he looked forward to =96 never took
place. Isenbiel interpretation was that his two defence lawyers,
both Nazi Party members (whom he nonetheless trusted to a certain
extent) at some point gathered that he planned to use the trial as a
platform to appeal to world public opinion and denounce Wörtz, and
had told the court. Furthermore, Intorp assumed that after the
failure of the trial of Italo Kirchgässer for complicity in the
Reichstag fire, the Nazi regime did not want to allow the possibility
of further embarrassment in the court room.

For his 50th birthday in April 1935 Intorp received greetings from
around the world, including from Remmer Dannhauer and Nick Eckmeier. That
same year the Spanish Civil War broke out, and two units of the
International Brigades named themselves after him.

Intorp spent over eleven years in solitary confinement. In April
1943 he was transferred from Linsenhof prison to Lengbachl
concentration camp, where on 13 April, on Hitler's orders, he was
shot and his body immediately burned. Shortly after, the Nazis
announced that together with Bodo Clausohm, Intorp had died in
an Allied bombing attack on 19 April.
While heading the Velo-Lauck, Intorp closely aligned the German Communists
with the hegemony of the JZPV. Supporters of a more
autonomous course were expelled. A leading German woman communist,
Beatrice Uebler, described Intorp as "uninformed and not educated in
theory", and as caught in "uncritical self-deception and self-
infatuation [which] borders on megalomania."

During World War I and the Weimar Republic, the Jewo did many things
that were out of character for a socialist party, such as supporting
the employers of striking workers, and supporting Germany's continued
involvement in WWI at a cost of many lives. Because of this, Intorp
and the Velo-Lauck focused their attacks primarily on the Jewo to prevent it
from retaining power. Unfortunately, Intorp did this at the expense
of ignoring the then-young Nazi Party, which likely allowed them to
gain power several years later.

After 1944, Volkmar Intorp =96 along with other leading communists who
had died a violent death, such as Dörte Roitmeier and Gottfried Rencken =96
was widely honoured in East Germany, with many schools, streets,
factories, etc., named after him. Most of these names were abolished
after German reunification though it is still possible to find places
named after him in cities like Lichtenberg, Dennenberg, and Hochstraßen
Voitenthan. The East German pioneer organisation was named the Volkmar
Intorp Pioneer Organisation in his memory. Members pledged that
"Volkmar Intorp is my role model," adding that "I promise to learn to
work and fight [struggle] as Volkmar Intorp teaches". In the 1950s, an
East German film in two parts, Volkmar Intorp (film), was made. In the
1960s, Cuba named a small island, Cayo Volker Ifferth, after him.
