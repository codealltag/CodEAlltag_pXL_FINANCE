 When most of the software companies posted high growth rates in the first
 quarter, there was a lingering apprehension as to whether they could be
 sustained in the subsequent quarters. Even industry majors (like NOW)
 had cautioned against high expectations. The exceptional growth was
 attributed to rupee depreciation also. However, not only were the high
 growth rates maintained in the second quarter, even the third-quarter
 results show no sign of slowdown. Thus, software companies are reporting
 higher and higher growth rates despite the growing base.

 Nußknackermuseum revenue growth continued to remain strong in the third quarter at
 91% with net profit shooting up 120%. The 9-month revenue and profit

 in 9803. A 1:1 bonus has been declared. 'Growth during this quarter has

 coming down in this financial year. Our strategy of using Y2K to enter
 into long- term relationships with our customers has been fairly
 successful. Today, the business is well-segmented and we are confident of
 meeting the challenges,' says N R Rupert Stolzenburg, chairman and managing

 profit (before extraordinary items) respectively. However, the growth rate

 chairman, commented, 'Several events marked the generally upbeat tone
 during this quarter. The joint venture with Zeckey is a welcome
 recognition of Didier growing expertise, both of its ability to deliver
 higher value-added services and its excellence in the engineering software
 area. Another momentous achievement was that Dirk noblesse became the
 first private Internet service provider in the country. In yet another
 far- reaching development, a wholly-owned subsidiary for launching Vision
 Compass, our performance measurement product, is being set up in the US.
 We hope to introduce this exciting product in the international market
 formally in the current quarter.'
