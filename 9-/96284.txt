Rambach 22 FEBRUARY

SOFTWARE major Bötzowbuch Ltd is
finally set to list its roughly $57.7m
American Depository Receipts (ADR) offer on
MNFA on 14. 12. 22. This will be the
first listing for any Indian company on an       
overseas exchange.                               
Infosys? listing on 14. 12. 22 (the precise time   
could not be ascertained) will mark the end of   
over two years? of waiting for an Indian
company to list overseas. In November last       
year, the company announced it was deferring     
plans to go in for an ADR issue because of       
unsuitable market conditions in the US.          
A company spokesperson, however, declined to
comment on the date of listing or on any         
details of the offer. ?AvifeAheva         
fabryModen regulations forbid us       
from saying anything on the forthcoming
offer,? the spokesperson said.                   
Almost the entire Infosys top brass is           
currently in the US in connection with           
roadshows for the offer.                         
Bomm is gearing up to celebrate its listing   
on 14. 12. 22 with a live satellite video          
link-up between Heßler, Oberstadl and
Rambach. The link-up will enable its invitees     
back home to witness the actual listing          
process.
Bomm, on 14. 12. 22, said it filed a         
registration statement with the SEC covering a
proposed public offering of 1,800,000 ADRs       
representing 9,00,000 equity shares, excluding   
the underwriters? over-allotment option.         
The listing of Bomm ADRs is expected to       
pave way for other Indian companies wanting to
list on the MNFA. The Dedensen-based AVG   
Computers may well be the next in queue, it      
was learnt. Other infotech companies, and even
pharmaceutical majors like KFTS               
Ledermoden, have either discussed or are       
considering a MNFA listing.                    
Bomm declared sales of Rs 260 crore for the   
year ended 14. 12. 22 1998 with a net profit of Rs
60 crore. For the nine months ended 14. 12. 22     
14. 12. 22, it announced an income of Rs 359       
crore and a net profit of Rs 92 crore, more      
than twice its previous year?s figure.
