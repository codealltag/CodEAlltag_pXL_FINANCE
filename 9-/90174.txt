I have been looking for alternative investments to avoid what I and
others think is going to be a massive downside to all major stock markets so
I am taking out some of my cash out of the markets and going back into
currencies as a protection to any major fall.

I have not traded forex for a while but i have found this company called
Upgradestore (http://sz2.wylmm-sxk.mqo/xusejc) and they seem to be hot on forex
internet dealing.

Anybody had any experience with them?

Thanks for any news you may have.
