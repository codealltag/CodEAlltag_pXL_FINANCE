Quantum Index : A New Technical Analysis

The weekly cycle chart indicates that the critical resistance point is
located at 1.0871 and the critical supporting point is at 1.0593. Two other
chart points can be found at 1.0747 and 1.0655 (N.B. this set of chart points
is good for next week only). Each quantum jump is represented by 0.0031 and
all projected chart points are interrelated and are separated by a multiple
of this constant, 0.0031. This forecast is based on a mathematical model and
it may or may not predict the market movement correctly. See details at
