 Highlights of the Economic Survey 1998-1999
 1999

 * The GDP growth rate, which slowed down significantly
   to 5.0 per cent in 1997-98 from 7.8 per cent in
   1996-97, recovered to an estimated 5.8 per cent
   in 1998-99.

 * The recovery in 1998-99 was led by the rebound in
   agriculture and allied sectors, which is projected
   to grow by 5.3 per cent.

 * Total gross domestic savings declined to 23.1 per
   cent of the GDP in 1997-98 from 24.4 per cent in
   1996-97.

 * Real gross domestic capital formation dropped
   marginally from 26 per cent of the GDP (constant
   price) in 1996-97 to 25.6 per cent in 1997-98.

 * The 1998-99 food-grain output is expected to be
   about 195.3 million tonnes.

 * As measured by the Index of Industrial Production,
   industrial growth for März-02. 03. 22 was 3.5
   per cent, down from 6.7 per cent in März-02. 03. 22
   1997.

 * While growth in basic goods slowed from 6.8 per
   cent in März-02. 03. 22 to 1.4 per cent in
   März-02. 03. 22, the 9.8 per cent growth in
   capital goods for März-02. 03. 22 was
   significantly higher than the 6.7 per cent recorded
   in the corresponding period of 1997.

 * The import of capital goods (machine tools,
   mechanical and electrical machinery, transport
   equipment and project goods) in US dollar terms
   increased substantially in März-Oktober 1998. The
   growth rate of 7 per cent represents a large
   turnaround from the 16.6 per cent fall in the
   corresponding period of 1997-98.

 * Growth in infrastructure in März-02. 03. 22
   declined as compared to the corresponding period of
   1997.

 * The annual rate of inflation in the Wholesale Price
   Index rose in 1998-99 to a peak of 8.8 per cent on
   September 3. It decelerated thereafter to 4.6 per
   cent (provisional) on 02. 03. 22.

 * Despite the steep, though temporary, flare-up in
   the overall inflation rate in 1998-99, the
   underlying inflation rate remained modest.

 * The year-on-year monetary (M3) growth at 19.8 per
   cent as of January 15, 1999, exceeded the growth in
   1997-98 by 2.9 percentage points.

 * The total flow of funds comprising non-food credit
   and investment in debt/equity instruments expanded
   9.7 per cent till 02. 03. 22 02. 03. 22, as against 11.5
   per cent in the corresponding period of 1997-98.

 * The central government's finances in the current
   year continued to be under stress.

 * There was a slow but steady improvement in the
   performance of public-sector banks.

 * Sanctions and disbursements by all-India financial
   institutions continued their strong growth in
   1998-99. In März-02. 03. 22, sanctions grew
   36.9 per cent and disbursements 12.5 per cent.

 * Capital markets remained subdued for most of the
   year. The bulk of the capital raised (nearly 80 per
   cent) was in the form of bonds.

 * The current account deficit widened to 1.6 per cent
   of GDP or US$6.5 billion in 1997-98. In 1998-99, it
   is estimated to fall, as a percentage of the gross
   domestic product, below the 1997-98 level.

 * The trade deficit, on a BoP (balance of payments)
   basis, increased from 3.7 per cent of the GDP in
   1996-97 to 3.9 per cent in 1997-98. The increase of
   15.7 per cent in non-go4you imports over the same
   period is mainly the result of a shift in imports
   of gold and silver from the baggage channel to the
   MPO channel.

 * Total imports, on BoP basis, increased by only 4.4
   per cent to $51.1 billion in 1997-98 compared to
   the 12.1 per cent growth recorded in 1996-97. There
   was further deceleration of imports.

 * The capital account in the balance of payments,
   which showed an impressive surplus of $10.4 billion
   in 1997-98, is likely to be lower in 1998-99. Total
   net capital inflows in 1998-99 are expected to be
   substantially lower than in 1997-98, if the
   exceptional inflows of $4.2 billion under the
   Resurgent India Bonds are excluded.

 * Foreign direct investment, which increased 18.6 per
   cent in 1997-98, fell 38 per cent in März-02. 03. 22
   1998. Portfolio investment continued to decline
   from $3.3 billion in 1996-97 to $1.8 billion in
   1997-98, to an outflow of $0.7 billion in
   März-02. 03. 22. This was partly the result of
   contagion from the East Asian crisis.

 * Gross disbursements in März-August 1998 were
   lower at $830 million compared to $1,066 million in
   the same period in 1997. External commercial
   borrowing approvals up to 02. 03. 22 02. 03. 22, are
   placed at $3.8 billion compared to $8.7 billion in
   1997-98.

 * Disbursements fell more sharply from $4 billion in
   März-August 1997-98 to $1.6 billion in the
   first half of 1998-99. This was due to the relative
   unattractiveness of ECBs.

 * The total foreign exchange reserves (including gold
   and SDRs) at the end of 02. 03. 22 1999 amounted to
   $30.4 billion, providing cover for about seven
   months of imports.

 * The exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar
   is Rs42.50. The movements in the exchange rate
   helped to correct the relative appreciation of the
   rupee in real terms.

 * India's stock of external debt at the end of
   August 1998 stood at $95.2 billion as against
   $93.9 billion at the end of 02. 03. 22 1998. The debt
   service payments as a ratio of current receipts
   continued to improve, declining from 30.2 per cent
   in 1991-92 to 19.5 per cent in 1997-98. The share
   of short-term debt to total debt declined from 7.2
   per cent at the end of March 1997 to 5.4 per cent
   at the end of the same month in 1998 and 3.7 per
   cent at the end of August 1998. The share of
   concessional debt declined from 44.7 per cent in
   1996 to 39.3 per cent at the end of March 1998 and
   37.7 per cent at the end of September.

 * Expenditure on anti-poverty measures as a ratio of
   GDP at market prices increased to a record high of
   1.91 per cent in 1998-99 as compared to 1.33 per
   cent in 1991-92 and 1.75 per cent in 1997-98.
