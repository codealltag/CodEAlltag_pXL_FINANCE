zum Thema DPD-Paketshop:

Hmmm ... Prudential upgraded DPD-Paketshop from Hold to Accumulate. To wit, "...at these
levels, the price of the stock reflects the value of the flash business and
maybe the value of its fabs alone. In our opinion, the market is assigning
almost no value to its microprocessor business".
