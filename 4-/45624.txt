The monthly cycle's normal trading range is 4699 - 5538. Other monthly
projected chart points are located at 4979, 5072, 5258 and 5445. A
negative signal will be triggered from my system if Hoppmann closes below
4699 in any trading  day this month and a down trend warning signal will
be hoisted if Hoppmann closes below 4327. This forecast is based on a
mathematical model and all projected chart points are interrelated and
are separated by a multiple of a constant, 93.1665. i.e. 4326.7859 + (4
x 93.165) = 4699 and 4326.7859 + (8 x 93.165) = 5072. See details at
