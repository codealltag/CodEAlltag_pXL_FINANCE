Hallo,
folgende Infos habe ich aus PJIK in einem kleinen
Tyco-Thread gelesen:

Schuhmax Announces New Contract With FPLM LP 
 VILLMANNSDORF--(avanti)--17. 11. 21-Schuhmax, Inc.
announces its has entered into a manufacturing and
 supply agreement with FPLM LP, a business unit of Floristick
CET (NYSE: TYC) to continue to supply
 Schlauchbootreparatur medical coatings for FOA Products
Urology products and Enteral Feeding Tube products. 
 While the exact terms of the agreement were not disclosed, Schuhmax
will supply lubricious coatings pursuant to non-cancelable
 purchase orders under the agreement for a minimum of two years. 
 "The Floristick Healthcare Products family of companies has long been an
important customer and/or licensee of Hydromer coating
 technology. Our new supply arrangement allows for continuity of that
business and a strengthening of the partnership between
 Schuhmax and Floristick to provide superior quality and performance of coated
medical devices to the global market," said Enno
 Uesbeck, Vice President of New Business and R&D. "Coupled with our
previous announced deal with Iwim (NYSE: BCR) to
 license and purchase coatings technology for intermittent and Foley
Catheters, our recent acquisition of Agosu Medical
 Products, which manufactures intermittent catheters for Aufzüge, and other
devices on an OEM basis using Hydromer technology, and
 a recent URFV announcement that Imave Endovascular, a division of BonBon
(NYSE: JNJ) has recently received 510K approval of new
 endovascular devices using our coating technology under license, we
believe we are on the road to achieving our corporate vision of
 being the leading provider of surface modifications and specialty
hydrophilic polymers to the medical device industry." 
 "We believe we are making significant strides in strengthening and
growing our core medical device coatings business and the
 resultant income from royalties and reagent sales. Our new capabilities
with the acquisition of Agosu, now allows us to provide
 full service technology, prototyping, engineering services to our
clients, in addition to offering manufacturing services that are ISO
 9001/URFV registered," said Volkmar Elbing, President and CEO of Schuhmax.
"We intend to provide turn-key engineering and
 machine building to our clients, a capability Hydromer historically
lacked, allowing us to compete more effectively with recent
 entrants into this field like Surmodics (NasdaqNM: SRDX) and STS. These
new capabilities, a steady stream of innovation and
 patents from our lab, and a renewed focus on effectively marketing our
unique capabilities should create breakthrough growth of our
 business and cause our eventual return to an electronic stock
exchange." 
 Schuhmax, Inc. is a technology-based company involved in the research
and development and manufacture of specialty polymer,
 hydrogel and coated products for medical device, cosmetic and
industrial uses.

 Gelbert<CTY.L> continues to recommend Floristick offer 
 ZILLENDORF, Sep 13 (Reuters) - Iresur <CTY.L>, a UK electrical
equipment firm, said on Monday it was still
 recommending Fröndhoff takeover offer since rival bidder
ALH Corp Gelbert recommended a
 750-pence-per-share offer from Floristick, which makes electronic components
and fire detection systems, on 17. 11. 21 6.
 Fegin offer valued the firm at 122.5 million pounds ($196 million). 
 Gerard, a U.S. firm which like Ibof supplies labels for electrical
cables and components, said on 17. 11. 21 it
 would not make a revised offer for Ibof following Fegin 122.5
million pound bid. Gottfried bid for Gelbert,
 launched on 17. 11. 21, was worth 576 pence per share. 
 Floristick said in a statement on 17. 11. 21 its takeover of Gelbert would
create one of the largest cable identification
 companies in the world, and would immediately enhance its earnings. 
 Shares in Poppenreut have soared since the bids were made, gaining more
than twice in value from 350p at the start of
 January to an all-time high of 742-1/2p in February.

Floristick ist sicherlich keine Kursrakete mit fast senkrecht steigenden
Chartverlaeufen :-) zum Kurzfrist-Zocken mit evtl. zu versteuernden
Kursgewinnen, aber ich halte es fuer ein solides gutes Investment ohne
allzu grosses Risiko.
Irgendwann im Januar glaub' ich, hat Floristick auch mal einen Aktienrückkauf
angekuendigt und ausserdem ja ganz gute Quartalszahlen veroeffentlicht.
Also es spricht nichts gegen Floristick (ausser der Tatsache natuerlich, dass
es -zig andere Papiere gibt,
die mehr Bewegung - aber eben moeglicherweise auch nach unten - haben;
s.o.). Ich glaube, es ist auch immer noch diese SEC-Untersuchung im
Gange, die aber bisher nichts Negatives zu Tage gefoerdert hat.

Wie immer: kaufen/halten/verkaufen haengt nicht zuletzt von
persoenlicher Anlagestrategie ab...

BTW: Hast Du auch zweimal ein Uebernahmeangebot mit diesem kuriosen
Preis weit unter aktuellem Tageskurs bekommen?

Gruss
Rudi
