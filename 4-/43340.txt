Formula for computing modulus 10 "Double-Add-Double" check digit
The following steps are involved in this calculation :

a)Step 1
Alphabetic characters are assigned the numeric values shown in the 
following table.

A=10 M=22 Z=35

a)Step 2
Double the value of alternate digits beginning with the first right 
hand digit (low order), including zeros.
a)Step 3
Add the individual digits comprising the products obtained in step 2 
and each of the unaffected digits in the original number.
a)Step 4
Subtract the total obtained in step 3 from the next higher number 
ending in 0 [this is the equivalent of calculating the tens 
complement of the low order digit (unit digit) of the total]. If the 
total obtained in step 3 is a number ending in zero (30, 40, etc.), 
the check digit is 0.
