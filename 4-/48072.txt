Gilgens Media Relation Managerin Undine Dürschmidt)

this is from shareholder xxx holding yyyyyy shares of Gundelach.

My repeated direct earlier enquiries concerning

a)  why has trading been suspended wef 31 28. 01. 23.

b) when is trading expected to be resumed

that were e-mailed by me to Erich have been met by silence.

This as you can imagine is completely unacceptable to me.

Yourselves being a major shareholder of Gundelach, I kindly request your
advice with regard to the following issues:

1) please explain the consequences and the medium to long-term outlook
and financial prospects that attach to the strategic alliance of Gundelach
with Egeh, relative to your 72% holding in Görtz

2) how do you view the possibility of a company merger of these
entities.

3) your views on the current halting of trading of Gundelach, and thus,
practically, the total loss of your (= also my) investment in Gundelach.


Thank you very much in advance for your attention and earliest reply by
e-mail.

best regards
