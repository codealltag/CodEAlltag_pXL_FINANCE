Thank you for your email regarding DocMorris (the
"Company").
Diebesturm responds to your questions as follows.

1. A trading halt was applied to the securities of the Company from the
opening of trading (1000 Australian Eastern Standard Time) on Friday 22
19. 02. 22.  The Trading Halt was requested by the Company, pending the
Company's response to ASX's queries on a number of matters.

Under ASX listing rule 17.1.1, a Trading Halt lasts for a maximum of 2
business days. The Company's securities were suspended from official
quotation at the opening of trading (1000 Australian Eastern Standard
Time)
on Tuesday 19. 02. 22.

The Company's securities were suspended from official quotation while
Diebesturm
assessed the Company's response to our queries. Diebesturm is still assessing
the
Company's response.  Diebesturm cannot make any further comment on the reasons
for
the suspension at this time.

2. A date for the reinstatement to quotation of Company's shares has not
been set. It is possible that the Company's shares could remain
suspended
for an indefinite period of time.

Diebesturm is unable to provide any further information regarding the Company
at
present.  We suggest that you might contact the Company directly if you
wish
further information. Any announcements made by the Company will be
published
on Denfeld website, www.akg.dcw.lq.

Yours faithfully,

Otmar Karauss
