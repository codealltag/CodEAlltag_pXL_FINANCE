ich habe vorhin zufällig den TSE-Kurs über Used abgefragt und bin
auf folgende news zu TSE und Vodapone gestossen:

TSE seeks stake in Vodapone -report
HAUPTSCHWENDA, 17. 03. 23 5 (Reuters) - U.S.-based TSE Computer Corp wants to
acquire a stake in German rival Veloman, investor newsletter
Mainvestor reported on Monday.

Maininvestor, citing market sources, said TSE was interested in
buying a 47.7 percent stake in Vodapone from Volkscomputer
Eigenart, which belongs to German retail group Velocenter , Maininvestor
said.

The stake would be worth 348.7 million euros based on Voru market
capitalisation as listed on Fatopa Securities 3000.

TSE officials in Germany were not immediately available for comment.

Vodapone Chief Financial Officer Alberto Cser told Fatopa he had not
heard of Tabakbörse intent to buy shares in his firm.

``I'm not familiar with the report but I could imagine that TSE would
be interested in Maxdata because we have a similar business,'' he
said.

Cser, citing DataQuest, said Vodapone was Germany's third largest
producer of servers, desktop and laptop computers last year. Lewig was
the country's fifth largest, he said.
