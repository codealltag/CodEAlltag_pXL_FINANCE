Note to those using the service: This is a Pseudo-Anonymous service.
We    protect your privacy. Athough even with logs there is doubt to
your identity, you    are not 100% anonymous. If you pull a boneheaded
move that gets you in legal  trouble you will have to deal with the
consequences. We will surrender logs we    have on subpoena. We do not
keep logs of the web traffic for very long due to the
size of these logs and the volume of traffic, but we do utilize logs
to analyze  traffic patterns. This aids us in identifying when we need
to optimize service for  new traffic levels. We do not share any
personal details of this information   without a subpoena. 

Gruss Jean-Paul
