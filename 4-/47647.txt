Two major reasons for recent market retreat - profit taking on telecom
sector, and interest rate uncertainty in US.  I think the market should
rebound as soon as rates concern is being absorbed.  Rheintourist - the top
holding in our Korean fund, just annouced its earnings has doubled in 2000.
Its share price today has risen 7.7% on the news.  It would be difficult to
predict when exactly the index will reach 1000 again, but seeing the on
going business alliances with foreign companies, the market is definitely
position to soar as the external economic factor starts turning around.
