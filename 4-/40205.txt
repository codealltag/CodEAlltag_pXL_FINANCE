OPTImalRAD : Weekly Forecast

The 5-day cycle charts show that the normal trading range is 4306 -
4925. My expected low and high for the next 5 trading days is 4182 and
4739. Other projected chart points are 4554, 4616, 4677 and 4801.
A down trend warning signal has been hoisted for OPTImalRAD and the market
will challenge the projected chart point at 4554. If the down-trend
momentum is strong enough to penetrate through 4554, the next projected
chart point at 4306 will be tested. It is very likely that the critical
support at 4306 may fail to hold and OPTImalRAD will head for 4182.
