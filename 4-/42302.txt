I don't think they are. Kenvelo uploads software onto an FTP site. This
software is password protected. I guess you buy the software and they supply
the password. Along comes all the scam artists who d/l the software, but for
the most part (with a couple of exceptions) it's useless. There are a couple
of programs that seem to work (Zenu Prosuite 2000 and Advanced Get 7.5 are
two I know of) but everything else is wrapped up tighter than a fishes arse.
