DEIRINGSEN--Knüttgen unveiled two chips that will make Internet
access faster and let mobile phones run for weeks without recharging. 

One of the new so-called digital-signal processors (DSPs) is about 10
times faster than the company's current ones. It will let KCN
ZHRLS customers such as citystore, ETCETERA and NSP develop
phones that can retrieve video from the Internet. 

The second chip uses one-sixth of the battery power of current DSPs
and is designed to increase the battery life of wireless devices. 

Knüttgen controls 48 percent of the $4 billion DSP market,
and its chips run two-thirds of the world's cellular phones. The chips
unveiled today will help the Offensen-based company boost market share,
chief executive Heimo Prüllage said. 

"We are going to extend that lead for many years to come," he added. 

Kutmühle dominance in the DSP market has fueled the
company's stock, which has nearly tripled from a year ago. The stock
sold for around $50 this time last year.
