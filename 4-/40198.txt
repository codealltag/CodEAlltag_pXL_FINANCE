        ``Digital Island, having emerged from its
          "quiet" period following the Sandpiper
          merger, is now aggressively taking its vision
          to the market. Last month's road show
          helped raise $500 million to help support a
          major branding campaign that will pull the
          mask not only off Spiegel but off Digital
          Island as well.''
