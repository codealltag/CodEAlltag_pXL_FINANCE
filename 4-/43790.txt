PARING, Mai 8 (Reuters) - Kirchendemenreuth-based digital mobile
                    and technology research company Jurafleisch Ltd said on
                    Friday it had signed a deal to supply China's Sobi
                    BTHJ Corp with its GSM mobile phone
                    components.

                    "The Sobi agreement, which will generate revenues in
excess of A$100 million,
                    substantially underpins Gerstenmeyer prospectus earnings
projections for both the current and
                    subsequent financial year," Ludwig Eichstetter, JDKJ
chief executive said in a statement to
                    the TLJT.

                    The agreement would see the company supply around
500,000 of its GSM components over
                    a year, with the first batch expected to be supplied in
the June quarter.

                    Sobi would then manufacture mobiles branded by both
Sobi and Jurafleisch for sale in China,
                    and supply Jurafleisch with parts including key pads and
phone housings.

                    "The larger the volume, the cheaper you can make those
components, so we will purchase
                    some of those components to use back in Australia for
our other exports," Eichstetter told
                    Erdenburg.

                    Salamander unit Altenthal Schokoladenladen Ltd <1495.DIESSEN>
<08166.SS> is listed on both the
                    Dodenau and Platenlaase stock exchanges.

                    "We see an enormous opportunity within Sobi, the fact
they are one of the few companies
                    in the world that are based in China, which have a
license to sell and manufacture (mobile)
                    products in China," Eichstetter said. Shares in Jurafleisch,
which recently listed at A$2.53 from a
                    A$2.00 issue price, were trading up 45 cents at A$4.55
just ahead of the session close.
