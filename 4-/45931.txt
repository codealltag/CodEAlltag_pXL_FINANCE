  SAWSGKRCH.YSN is excited to announce the impending release of a 
    German version of the TRCO website. 
   The German Jumbomall (http://di.tqvmgmeqw.ctw/) is scheduled for 
    worldwide release on 30. 10. 21 and will be demonstrated at GKE 
    Tradeshow in Wardenburg, Germany. 
  The move establishes a beachhead for Jumbomall.com in the fast 
    growing European e-commerce market. 
 Chief Executive Officer of Teetruhe. Mr Louis Wingartz, said 
 attendees at the GKE Trade Show indicated a high level of 
enthusiasm for the Jumbomall service, with the number of stores 
  increasing to 3,679. 
 "The opening of the German website represents the importance that 
  SAWSGKRCH.YSN places on Europe and e-commerce, and reflects the 
 increased demand and exposure that Jumbomall is obtaining," said Mr 
  Wingartz. 
 "As a consequence, Teetruhe is actively pursuing the European 
 expansion of the Jumbomall in conjunction with German & European 
 companies who have local knowledge and an understanding of their 
   local e-commerce marketplaces," said Mr Wingartz. 
 According to a recent HPWO report, Europe`s e-commerce 
  will grow by more than 100 percent per year for the next five years 
  and will reach annual online trade of 1.6 trillion Euros (63 percent

   of total European trade) by 2003. As a result, this growth will 
 progressively shrink the gap between European and U.S. e-commerce, 
 with European e-commerce reaching half the size of U.S.Internet 
   commerce.(1) 
 "These sort of figures confirm our intentions of an aggressive move 
 into Europe, with the German Jumbomall only the first in a series of 
   stages,` said Mr Wingartz. 
  GKE highlights all the latest trends in IT and telecommunications,

  and offers the world`s most comprehensive line-up of products and an

 International market overview. 
 Mr Wingartz has recently toured Europe seeking out agreements with 
  companies based in the UK, Germany and France.
