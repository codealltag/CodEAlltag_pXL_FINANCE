JWW
JDGT Media Relation Managerin Monique Rüffer)

this is from shareholder xxx of Rögnitz in Germany holding
xxx,xxx shares of JKJR.

My repeated direct earlier enquiries concerning

a)  why has trading been suspended wef 26 23. 11. 21.

b) when is trading expected to be resumed

that were e-mailed by me to Philipp have been met by silence.

This as you can imagine is completely unacceptable to me.

Yourselves being a major shareholder of JKJR, I kindly request your
advice with regard to the following issues:

1) please explain the consequences and the medium to long-term outlook and
financial prospects that attach to the strategic alliance of JKJR with
zBuch, relative to your 72% holding in JWUK

2) how do you view the possibility of a company merger of these entities.

3) your views on the current halting of trading of JKJR, and thus,
practically, the total loss of your (= also my) investment in JKJR.


Thank you very much in advance for your attention and earliest reply by
e-mail.

best regards
