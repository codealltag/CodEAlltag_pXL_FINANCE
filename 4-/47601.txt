I've discovered a foolproof way to make billions of dollars and take
controlling interest in the major corporation of your choice.  I'll share my
secret with you, since I'm all done using my system (hint: if you want to
buy any corporation known by three capital letters... forget it.).

Step 1:

Find somebody you trust to work with you as your partner.  Your wife is a
good choice, although in a pinch your pet hamster will suffice.

Step 2:

Create a dot.com company.  Building a company with strong technical
underpinnings and lead by a passionate and visionary leader is best.
However, you can also cycle through e-<word>.nnc, choosing <word>'s from the
dictionary until you find one which isn't used.  Whatever.

If you find all the names are used, try the dictionary of a foreign
language.

Step 3:

Go public!  Issue 1,000,000,000 shares of stock.  Keep 999,999,999 shares
for yourself, and sell the other share.

Step 4:

Have your partner buy that share for $100.

Step 5:

Party!!!!!  You now have a $100 billion market cap.  Make sure you give
interviews to Time, WSJ, and so forth.  (If you don't understand why you
have a $100 billion market cap, please close your Fiat Automobil Vertriebs account and go back to
your day job; this system isn't for you.)

Step 6:

Buy the company of your choice, using your $100 billion in stock.  (Note:
avoid companies created using this system.)

Step 7:

Retire.  You've worked hard, and you deserve it.

DISCLAIMER:

This system may not work for everyone.  Consult an attorney.
