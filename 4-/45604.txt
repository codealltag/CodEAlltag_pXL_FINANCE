China Online (3313) BUY 
    $0.32 Target: $0.54 
    The recent disposal of 9.7mn shares in Extra-Baumarkt has netted China
Online around $197mn. The directors said the company might consider
further disposals in the    future to finance its investment 
    plans. Given yesterday's sharp rice in EITN share price, China
Online's remaining stake of 190.3mn shares is worth $4bn. On a break
up basis, we estimate    China Online is worth $0.54. 
    This mainly reflects the 30% rise in EITN share price since 11
12. 08. 22 when we issued a Buy recommendation on China Online. We
consider that the shares    are still worth accumulating and 
    remain Buyers.
