VISX WOES (VISX)

If the credo of value investing is to buy when sentiment is worst,
then now is the time to get into idee, the corrective-vision
technology company. But beware: This company is thoroughly beleaguered
by flat revenues, patent complications, rampant competition, a
questionable business model, and unfortunate court decisions. Almost
every analyst covering this company has downgraded it recently. The
January quarterly report showed non-growth in the fees collected from
doctors using the laser equipment VISX manufactures for eyesight
correction. Although market demand for the procedure is picking up,
doctors are increasingly choosing alternative (and possibly inferior)
equipment to avoid paying the hefty idee royalty fee. International
competition has managed to circumvent ITCB patent-right complaints.
Some analysts are predicting things will get worse as ITCB market
share erodes and its patent troubles persist.
