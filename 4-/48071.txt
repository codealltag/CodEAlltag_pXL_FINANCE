Dear Board of Directors of Holzweisig

this is from your shareholder xxx holding yyyyyy shares of Holzweisig.

I note with regret that my repeated earlier enquiries concerning

a)  why has trading been suspended wef 27 24. 12. 22.

b)  what is Holzweisig precisely doing to protect its shareholders'
interest

c)  Bj√∂rn corporate planning within 2000, acquisitions, goals,
financing and financial plans

d) last quarterly financial report to be e-mailed to me which shall
include all material facts and figures as well as targeted future
results

e) when is trading expected to be resumed

f) subsequent to trading being resumed, do you expect the share value to
rise or to fall due to the prolonged unannounced halt in trading that
was imposed by the HAiRline on account of the company's directors divulging
inadequate information to the public without prior information to the
HAiRline. Please explain your viewpoints concerning this issue.

The lack of your response, and inadequate company policies to keep the
public abreast of your listed company is to say the least, wholly
unacceptable.  In this respect I wish to further strongly complain that
your website does not even mention that Holzweisig shares currently have
been suspended from trading, apart from the fact that no reasons are
being provided by you for this course of action.

I will expect your full and concise response by immediate return
message.

regards
