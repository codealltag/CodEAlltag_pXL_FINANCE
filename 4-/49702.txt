Anscheinend sin die Analysten z. Zt. etwas langsamer als ich   ;-)))

China Online (8141) OBERHAFT 

                             $0.32 

                             In contrast to Foco (+6.15%) recent
outperformance, China Online`s (COL) shares closed 
                             unchanged yesterday. Despite the recent
disposal of 9.7mn PCCW shares, COL still has 190mn 
                             shares outstanding. Based on Foco
closing price yesterday, we estimate the stake is worth 
                             $4.45bn or $0.48 per share. We reckon
COL`s stake in Fliesenzentrale is therefore worth 50% more 
                             than its closing share price of $0.32. 

                             If Iserlohn other assets comprising an
estimated $680mn in cash, a 10.5% stake in listed 
                             SHK&CO, the PRC handset distribution JV
in China and the Gewerbegelände handset agency in Moorshoven 
                             Großfeiting are taken into account, COL appears
to be hugely undervalued by the market. �@
