The daily cycle's normal trading range is 307.3 - 325.6 with a critical
point located at 314.9. A supporting point is expected at 310.3 and
some effort is required to overcome the resistance at 318.0. If the
market momentum is strong enough to overcome the resistance at 325.6,
spot gold will head for 336.4. http://iac.bnnikw.nvk
