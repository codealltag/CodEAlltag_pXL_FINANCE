Hi!


Ich find' das äußerst bedenklich,
aber vieleicht war's ja auch das:

YELLOWBUBBLE COM INC - Closing of Acquisition
 and Completion of Financing  
 Tue 28. 02. 23 17 02:24:00 EST 2001  

 Eckerding, Eckerding, F. 28. 02. 23 (Market News Publishing via NOI)
-- Samu I. 
 Neuland, President of X-Vision, Inc. (XXQuell) announces the
closing 
 of the acquisition of UK based X-Vision Holdings Ltd
(Holdings). Closing 
 took place on Thursday 28. 02. 23 12, 2000 and includes the first $1.5
million of a US 
 $5 million finance agreement to X-Vision Inc. 

 The three founders of Holdings, Karsten Verfondern (CEO), Clemens Boness 
 (Marketing Director) & Rainer Hoppner (Deputy CEO/Corporate Secretary),
are the 
 newly appointed directors of X-Vision Inc. Samu I. Neuland will
remain as 
 President. 

 Yellowbubble is creating a global on-line community and aims to service
that 
 community with targeted benefits. The directors and their marketing
team have 
 extensive track records and experience in creating terrestrial
communities 
 across the European continent over the past decade. The integration of
proven 
 off-line marketing strategies that they possess and the new ground
breaking 
 on-line viral growth strategies positions them to capture a share of
the fast 
 growing European web community. 

 Phase one will see the introduction of a business model where
advertisers and 
 surfers are brought together through yellowbubble's proprietary
Profiling 
 Engine(TM) software. This allows the streaming of highly targeted ads
into 
 yellowbubble's proprietary AdBox(TM) software onto the surfer's
desktop. Members 
 of the community will be paid to have ads delivered to their computers
and will 
 also be incentivised to refer others to join the community. The
directors 
 believe that the combination of these proprietary software techniques
will add a 
 new dynamic to the already established "Paid to Surf" business
development 
 concept. "By sharing our advertising revenue with our members, we will
be paying 
 them for something they do anyway - surf the web", said Elisabeth Vermeersch,
CEO. 

 Phase two of yellowbubble's development program will be initiated by a 
 comprehensive consumer campaign to establish yellowbubble as a leading
operator 
 in the European market and the promotion of the companies mission "To
create a 
 substantial community, to trade profitably with chosen supply partners
and 
 manage the community for the benefit of it's members and our
shareholders".
